149
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,325
I think his wealth
is really something else.

150
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:58,204
It just blows my mind
that somebody can have 90 Rolls Royces.

That's really impressive.

It's a free country. I don't know.

154
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,046
If he's breaking the law,
I guess they should do something.

155
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,465
If he's not,
I suppose they should leave him alone.

[male reporter] This is not normally

Is it awkward or embarrassing for you?

183
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:42,058
It is absolutely awkward and embarrassing

184
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:46,604
because I'm absolutely innocent.
I have not done any crime.

185
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:50,316
I will first fight and finish the case

186
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,654
because I still see
that the American Constitution

187
00:10:54,737 --> 00:11:01,578
is one of the most valuable constitutions
in the world.

188

And it will support me and my commune.

00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:09,043
So I'm certain that I will win it.

190
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,964

and me sitting on the floor.

He was...

193
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,139
He was unchained.

194
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,726
He was just the same as when he was
sitting in front of 10,000 people

195
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,604
when he was sitting there
in prison dungarees.

196
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:37,113
And I would just sit there
and feel his presence and be renewed...

197
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,741
uh...

198
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,076

The fact of it is the charges

are almost never criminally prosecuted.

To seek to hold him in jail

that three days after a sealed indictment
was returned by the grand jury,

[male reporter]
<i>As you said all week long,</i>

311
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,970
<i>It's been something</i>
<i>of a cat and mouse game</i>

<i>between federal marshals and reporters</i>

313
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,390

about the exact time
and place of his arrival.

315
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,395
They take as long as legally possible

taking him from facility to facility,
bussing him around.

317

What it gave them the opportunity to do is
drag him around the country for two weeks.

318
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,407
I think it's a tragedy for this country...

319
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,120
that this innocent and beautiful man...

320
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,499
is being held in this country's prisons.

321

You know, this country is not
that far from the Wild West, right?

<i>They often refuse voluntary surrender</i>
<i>so they can get their perp walk.</i>

326
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:11,233
They like to arrest
and then put the person in the cuffs

327
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:16,530
and make them walk through this barrage
of lights to make them look guilty.

[man] <i>Well, to see a man</i>

330
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:27,166

is terrified of this man.

[male reporter]
<i>They persist in their belief that Bhagwan</i>

332

I don't want the man to die in jail.

336
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:45,643
That anyone could treat a man with
such grace and such beauty in that way,

337
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,478
I just don't understand it.

338
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:51,816
Uh... He is by no means being given
any special consideration

339
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,235
or any red carpet treatment so to speak.

340
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,571
I think our assumption was he probably
wouldn't like that bus ride.

00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,825

that the plane has now landed

<i>The abandonment,</i>

"You know this is

And Osho looked at me and said,
"Niren, what do you think?"

430
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,519

[voice breaking]
"Number one, if you fight this,

And Osho sat back as he always does.

441
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,105
Sat for a few minutes and looked off.

442
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,484
And then he said,
"If they will fight this--

443
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:12,696
If they would fight this fairly,
I would go to the Supreme Court.

the things that it has--

446
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,628
The things that it has been subjected to.

447
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,005
Uh...

448
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,175
Make a deal and I will leave."

[male reporter] Well, Mike and Shirley,
a remarkable scene

467
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,747
here at the federal courthouse.

468
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:49,001
U.S. Attorney Charles Turner
still being interviewed by reporters here

469
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,502
following the plea agreement.

470
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:53,380
A hearing this afternoon
before Judge Edward Levy.

471
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:57,801
Bhagwan said, quote, "I never want
to return to the United States again."

472
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,848
Now we're trying to get closer
to the U.S. Attorney Charles Turner,

who is still making a statement
regarding the conclusion

474
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,311
of this hearing this afternoon.
We'll see if we can get closer.

475
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,771
[male reporter]
Can you tell us again? We missed this.

476
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,357
- You guys got to be kidding.
- [male reporter] Yeah. I'm serious.

477
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:15,652
I was very pleased
about the disposition of this case

478
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:18,655
because I felt it was clearly
within the public interest.

479
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:22,034
It vindicated the investigation
conducted by this office

480
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,245
and it is a public concession of guilt
by Rajneesh.

481
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:27,039
[female reporter] There are certainly
members of the public

482
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,167
who really wanted to see this
go to a full-blown trial.

483
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,585
Well, the defendant can't--

484
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,588
We can't make a defendant go to trial
who wants to plead guilty.

485
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,048
[reporter chuckles]

486
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,382
All off these fellows

487
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:41,470
have been involved in this operation
for at least four years,

488
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:47,100
and this is a very satisfying
and successful conclusion to that process.

489
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,561
Kathy, I'd like to ask
Mr. Turner a question. Is he still there?

490
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:50,812
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Okay.

491
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,564
Mr. Turner, let me ask you this.

492
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:56,360
If you got what you wanted,
the Bhagwan's leaving the country,

493
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,487
why didn't you just let him leave
in the first place,

494
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,322
a couple of weeks ago that Sunday night?

495
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,407
<i>Well, that's not the way our system works.</i>

496
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:06,036
Somebody who had come here
and committed the nature of the crimes

497
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,538
that were committed
by Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh--

498
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:14,294
To let him leave the country as a fugitive
and to abdicate our responsibilities

499
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,338
simply would be inconsistent
with our oath of office.

500
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,048
We simply could not do that.

501
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,592
Uh... I would never have permitted that.

502
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,552
The laws on our books are enacted

503
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:27,224
in a democratic process
everyone participates in.

504
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:31,728
There's not an exception in those statutes
that says you don't have to do that

505
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:34,523
if you're smart enough to get away
before you get caught.

506
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,818
And the citizens of this state
needed to see

507
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:41,238
that the government
was going to hold him accountable

508
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,115
like we would everybody else.

509
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:49,329
[woman] That's far enough.
Give him some space, please.

510
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:50,539
[male reporter] Who are you?

511
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,874
- [woman] Please, give him some space.
- [male reporter] Who are you, lady?

512
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:59,548
And that night, he got on a jet
and left the United States.

513
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,303
None of his Sannyasins
will tell us where he's headed.

514
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,806
There are probably
about ten or 12 Sannyasins on the plane.

515
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:12,352
<i>They've loaded the plane</i>
<i>with various pieces of luggage and boxes.</i>

516
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,727
[female reporter]
<i>Before he got on the plane, he waved,</i>

517
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,855
<i>put his hands together</i>
<i>in the traditional sign and smiled,</i>

518
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,774
<i>and then turned and got on the plane.</i>

519
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,944
<i>We don't know at this point</i>
<i>where the plane is headed.</i>

520
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:06,948
All we suspect is that the Bhagwan
is reportedly leaving the country.

I thought there was going to have to be
some acceptance from both sides

528
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,836
and that's where we were headed.

529
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:06,591
But then I got up one morning and it had
all blown up and it was leaving.

530
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,552
- A big relief finally to get rid of them.
- I guess it was just a relief.

531
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:12,305
- Just--
- Yeah. That's over. [chuckles]

532
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,766
I'm elated about it. I really am.

533
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,018
I'm glad that he's gone.
I hope he never returns.

534
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,688
And I hope all these people
go right with him.

535
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,609
When I heard about it,
all I could do was heave a sigh of relief.

536
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:25,735
We're tired.

537
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,864
That's the best thing
that could have happened.

538
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,031
I think it's great.

539
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:34,995
I hope the whole camp or whatever,
town of Rajneeshpuram is, uh--

540
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,958
Uh, just packs up and leaves
for all I care. I don't like them.

541
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,084
He was scaring a lot of people.

542
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:45,046
And he was being dishonest
and he finally admitted his dishonesty

543
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,507
and stuck his tail
between his legs and took off.

544
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:50,802
I think it's time and I think it's
happening at a very appropriate time,

545
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,304
Thanksgiving.

546
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,638
And we are very grateful.

547
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:57,476
I thoroughly believe that there was
a divine hand behind all this.

548
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,979

has a place for these people.

by the state and federal government

have produced a situation
where it is no longer viable

591
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,947
And we left. And that's how it went.

592
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:08,958
At the ranch, I had an experience
of being loved and accepted totally.

593
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,211
Totally.

594

I felt like, "What just happened?"

00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,110
You know, I mean, we were
so busy fighting it

601
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:39,239
that, you know, it was only then
that I actually had a moment to reflect.

602
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:48,415
And because we were so raw, you know,
it was just like such an explosion.

603
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,293
<i>You know, to walk away from the garden...</i>

604

605

609
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:23,867
<i>And to recognize what an incredible gift</i>
<i>it was to be alive on this earth...</i>

610
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:25,952
You know, it was a town.

611
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:31,624
We actually did, in the end, build this
incredible city that was truly joyous.

612
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:36,004
<i>It was real people living real lives.</i>

613

And literally,
in the middle of the winter,

614
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:46,765
to drive away and know that this, too,
was going to become a ghost town...

615
00:37:56,399 --> 00:38:00,153
<i>It was just an amazingly surreal moment...</i>

736
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,362
<i>greet people...</i>

737
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:28,285
<i>and he would move across the podium</i>

738
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:33,165
while staying facing forward
to the people there, blessing them.

739
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:49,557
<i>And that time</i>
<i>I was sitting about three rows back</i>

740
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,810
and he was wavering a little bit.

741
00:46:54,270 --> 00:47:00,484
And at one time I could actually see
his toe was over the edge of the podium.

742
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:06,991
And I was just willing him to stay alive,

743
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:13,414
trying to give my life energy to him.

744
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:19,211
[crowd shouts]
Osho!

745
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,297
And the next day...

746
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:26,469
<i>everybody was called together</i>
<i>into the Buddha Hall.</i>

747
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:38,856
[Deva Raj] Yesterday morning, I noticed
that Osho was obviously leaving his body.

748
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:43,277
We sat on the bed
and he gave us his final words.

749
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:49,617
He said, "I leave you my dream."

750
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:59,460
He then lay back quietly and we sat
with him while I held his pulse.

751
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,925
Slowly it faded.

752
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:13,599
When I could hardly feel it,
I said to him, "Osho, I think this is it."

753
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:18,145
He just nodded gently
and closed his eyes for the last time.

754
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:50,886
His body was brought
into the... Buddha Hall...

755
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,731
and placed up on the podium.

756
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,991
[all shout]
Osho!

757
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:25,629
There are many other things
that he said that we'll let you know,

758
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,590
but for now let me just say to you

759
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:31,385
that, in death, he was just as you
would have expected, incredible.

760
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:34,930
[cheering and applause]

761
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:55,242
And then it was taken from there
to the burning ghats.

762
00:49:55,326 --> 00:50:00,956
Huge procession
with people carrying his body.

763
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:22,228
[rhythmic clapping and chanting]

764
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:28,943
And I was standing there,
uh... watching his body burn.

765
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:45,251
Such a gift... [voice breaks] he was.

766
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:49,838
Such a gift.

767
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,804
[cheering]

768
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,481
[chanting]

769
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:26,083
[Jane] <i>When I heard that Bhagwan,</i>
<i>now known as Osho, had died...</i>

770
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:30,754
<i>I was strangely indifferent.</i>

771
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:34,925
<i>That was something behind me.</i>

772
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:41,056
I'd been in prison
and now I was coming home.

773
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:45,769
I was 43 years old, but I was a child.

774
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,940
My parents opened their arms to me...

775
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,319
just held me...

776
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,696
<i>and took me home with them.</i>

777
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,615
<i>Not very long after,</i>

778
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:03,412
<i>I started running a juice bar</i>
<i>in Germany called the Saftladen.</i>

779
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:07,333
<i>I met my husband George in this juice bar.</i>

780
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:13,756
And slowly, slowly I began
to get back to planet Earth.

781
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:24,058
<i>At the same time, outside Germany,</i>

782
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:28,896
<i>there was still an international</i>
<i>arrest warrant hanging over my head.</i>

783
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:34,568
<i>The case to murder</i>
<i>Mr. Turner remained open.</i>

784
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:37,863
[female reporter]
<i>The prosecution alleged that the women</i>

785
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:41,116
<i>plotted to kill Oregon's</i>
<i>former U.S. Attorney, Charles Turner.</i>

786
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:46,455
<i>If found guilty, the women could be given</i>
<i>a life sentence in a U.S. jail.</i>

787
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:50,000
[Jane]
<i>But also at that time,</i>

788
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:53,295
<i>I had a stability I had never had before.</i>

789
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:59,551
<i>I was free from prosecution in America</i>
<i>as long as I could stay in Germany.</i>

790
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:02,262
<i>And one day...</i>

791
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,850
<i>in the middle of the night,</i>
<i>the phone rang.</i>

792
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,478
It was my daughter-in-law.

793
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:13,107
"Jane," she said. "Peter is in hospital."

794
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:19,363
I was hearing for the first time
that my son had a brain tumor...

795
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:21,907
and that he might die.

796
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:24,493
<i>I was in absolute shock.</i>

797
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:32,501
But the arrest warrant meant I could not
travel to Australia to go to my dying son.

798
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,504
I had to travel to America.

799
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:38,090
I had to throw myself
at the mercy of the court

800
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:41,427
without any guarantees whatsoever.

801
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:46,640
I wanted to be free to be able to go
to my children at a time like this.

802
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,769
<i>George and I went</i>
<i>to the airport in Frankfurt</i>

803
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,938
<i>and boarded a plane for Portland.</i>

804
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:58,152
<i>We walked together</i>
<i>to the federal courthouse.</i>

805
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,862
<i>It was raining that morning.</i>

806
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:03,282
I was very, very focused.

807
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:09,580
The court had the discretion
of sentencing me to life imprisonment,

808
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:15,210
but I knew that this was
what had to be done.

809
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:18,547
<i>As proceedings began,</i>

810
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,507
<i>first the prosecutor spoke</i>

811
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:25,220
and asked that the judge
sentence me appropriately.

812
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:27,055
Then it was my turn to speak.

813
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:31,602
I felt compelled to stand
to what I had done.

814
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,646
<i>I read my statement.</i>

815
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:40,611
<i>And then the moment</i>
<i>had come for sentencing.</i>

816
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:49,328
Judge Marsh said that sometimes justice
is stronger than mercy

817
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,871
and that's okay.

818
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:57,503
But sometimes mercy overrules justice.

819
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,798
And we have such a case before us today.

820
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:08,597
And therefore,
he was sentencing me to time served.

821
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,228
I was free.

822
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:17,856
I was free.

823
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,234
And through my tears,

824
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:24,863
I could see that everybody
in the courtroom was happy for me.

825
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:29,826
FBI agents came up to me, shook my hand,

826
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:35,249
and said "Congratulations, Mrs. Stork.
You deserve it."

827
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,043
I wasn't a criminal in that moment.

828
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:45,133
I was a free woman
with a son who was dying...

829
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,887
and that brought everybody together...

830
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:53,058
in a very human way.

831
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:57,771
Even today when I think about it...

832
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,526
Yeah, it brings tears to my eyes.

833
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:07,614
It was the most incredible experience

834
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:12,327
to become aware that they were
a lot of people around me that day

835
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:18,208
who were glad that I could go to my son
and be with him when he died.

836
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:34,224
[Sheela] <i>After prison,</i>
<i>I had to get back on my feet.</i>

837
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:40,814

838
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:49,114

<i>I left the Sannyasin community also.</i>

<i>It is time that Bhagwan's Sannyasins</i>
<i>open their eyes...</i>

841

and look at the reality
of what had happened to Bhagwan.

842
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,720
Bhagwan didn't have a natural death.

843
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:17,309
<i>This doctor,</i>
<i>who had written death certificate...</i>

844
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:22,147
felt it was with overdose.

845
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:31,698
[Deva Raj] <i>About nine months ago,</i>
<i>Osho formed the inner circle...</i>
