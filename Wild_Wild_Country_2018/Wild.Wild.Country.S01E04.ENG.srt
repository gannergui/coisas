I was sent by Sheela to support them.

151
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,381
I was filled with rage,

152
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,133
and I did a Sheela.

153

And we are going to infect.

154

not only Portland, not only Salem,

"Weaver in another rambling,
incoherent speech."

165

No direct concrete evidence

[female reporter]
But you have some of your own ideas?

172
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,280
I have my own views,
there is no question of that.

<i>Sheela was in a really difficult position.</i>

So, when Bhagwan told Sheela
she needed to be sure

00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:42,577
that Rajneeshees were elected
to the county commission,

183

it was for her so important

This was something very radical.

00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:39,780
they're going to get you.

305
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,908
I mean, they have the resources

306
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:48,038
and the ability
to basically go after anybody and succeed.

307
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,125
<i>But to have it done to your community,</i>

308
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,128
<i>and to have the government</i>
<i>not be just be unwelcoming...</i>

309
00:20:54,962 --> 00:21:00,092
<i>but to twist and violate their own laws,</i>
<i>their own procedures,</i>

310
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:04,847
and to be self-righteous in doing that.

311
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,559
Immigration was clearly a tool
to destroy the community.

312
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,146
I mean, immigration was the biggest tool
to destroy the community

313
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:16,692
because there was a whole lot
of pressure from Washington D.C.

314
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,029
to go after this guy
and get rid of this guy.

315
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:25,326
<i>The immigration investigation started</i>

316
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:31,165
when a political donor to the president
wrote to Edwin Meese

317
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,376
<i>and told Meese about this cult in Oregon</i>

318
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,296
<i>and that they should get rid of Osho.</i>

319
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:43,594
<i>One of the INS commissioners</i>
<i>wrote in a memo</i>

320
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,554
<i>that perhaps it's wishful thinking,</i>

321
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:50,810
<i>but our pressures may force them</i>
<i>to pick up and leave.</i>

322
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:55,523
<i>You know, they were spending time</i>
<i>with anti-cult experts.</i>

323
00:21:57,191 --> 00:22:00,486
<i>They were saying</i>
<i>that he cannot be a religious leader</i>

324
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,781
<i>because what he teaches</i>
<i>is the antipathy of religion.</i>

325
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,909
<i>In November of '82,</i>

326
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,579
<i>he applied for a visa</i>
<i>as a religious teacher and leader.</i>

327
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,750
[male reporter] <i>His goal was to convince</i>
<i>officials he should remain in the U.S.</i>

328
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,461
<i>He now wants to change his status</i>
<i>to that of religious worker</i>

329
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,047
<i>and remain</i>
<i>at his central Oregon ranch permanently.</i>

330
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,927
The INS issued a denial.

331
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,932
[female reporter] <i>The Immigration</i>
<i>and Naturalization Service has denied</i>

336

I want that guru and his evil influence

339
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,708
The immigration office
knows he's in this country illegally

340
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,128
and I want them to uphold the law
and get him out.

341
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,423
[male reporter] <i>The deportation order</i>
<i>against the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh</i>

No definite date has been set

344
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:08,929
The denials were a trip.

345
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:15,686
Our position was that as a result of
his silence for about a year and a half,

346
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,771
he could not and had not

347
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:21,358
performed the duties that the organization
described in their own document.

348
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,152
The only thing I'm hearing from you,

349
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,196
and I want to give you an opportunity
to tell me something more

350
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,575
if there is something, is that the man
doesn't talk publicly. Is that it?

351
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,332
He was not participating actively

352
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:40,753
in the religious ceremonies...

353
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:46,425
duties that the organization
described him as--

354
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:50,262
Or described as necessary
to the performance of his duties.

355
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,389
All right, Niren,
do you want to respond?

356
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,391
[Niren]
<i>Clearly, he qualified.</i>

357
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:58,646
I mean, if he's not a religious teacher
and leader, nobody's a teacher and leader.

358
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,565
<i>I was outraged by it.</i>

359
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:06,028
The INS is now simply uncomfortable with
the ludicrous nature of their position,

360
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,156
and that is that if you're in silence
you can't be a religious leader.

361
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,451
It's a bit like saying if the pope
has laryngitis, he stops being pope.

362
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,786
It doesn't make sense.

363
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,914
It's our position, and we have evidence
that there is bias,

364
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,458
there is prejudgment,
there is religious discrimination,

365
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,294
<i>there is racial discrimination.</i>
<i>They want him out of the country.</i>

366
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,046
And to try and get rid
of the rest of the disciples

367
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,923
who are in this country legally as well.

368
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:29,593
[Niren]
<i>I was actually a hero in that community...</i>

369
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,764
because I was, in a sense,
the tip of the spear,

370
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,225
fighting to survive.

371
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,186
People were so loving, so beautiful to me,

372
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:43,774
<i>so happy and grateful</i>
<i>that I was there to do what I could do.</i>

373
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,567
[laughing]

374
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:49,029
<i>I formed a nonprofit legal corporation.</i>

375
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:55,661
<i>We ended up with having like 20 lawyers,</i>
<i>25 paralegals at the ranch.</i>

376
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,584
Every issue was rebutted
with mountains of evidence.

377
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,839
[male reporter] <i>On Thursday,</i>
<i>the guru's attorneys appeared</i>

378
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,258
<i>at the immigration service office</i>
<i>in downtown Portland</i>

379
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,927

<i>explaining why their guru</i>
<i>should be allowed to stay.</i>

381
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:19,017
The INS had found that they couldn't,
they could not win.

382
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:22,104
<i>Their whole investigation</i>
<i>was replete with bias.</i>

383
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,523
<i>Their decisions were against the law.</i>

384
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,401
Are we running?

385
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,320
"On February 16, 1984,"

386
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,365
which happened to be my birthday,

387
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:39,413
"the INS granted his visa

388
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,166
as a religious teacher and leader."

389
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,627
They acknowledged he was
a religious teacher and leader.

390
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,839
[Niren]
All right! All right!

391
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,093
We didn't win much in Oregon...

392
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,137
but we won that one.

393
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:06,148
[Niren]
<i>But then...</i>

394
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,069
<i>Charles Turner got involved in this case.</i>

395
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:15,866
<i>The INS, having failed to deport him,</i>

396
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:20,788
<i>they referred it to the U.S. Attorney</i>
<i>to try and find a criminal prosecution.</i>

397
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:25,667
[Weaver] <i>Charlie Turner was</i>
<i>the gold standard for law enforcement.</i>

398
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,086
<i>When Ronald Reagan was elected president,</i>

399
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,798
<i>Charlie Turner was appointed</i>
<i>the United States attorney</i>

400
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:34,301
and asked me to serve
as his criminal division chief,

401
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,011
<i>which I was honored to do.</i>

402
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:40,390
<i>So when the Immigration Service</i>
<i>returned to us in sometime in 1983,</i>

403
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,392
<i>the case was there, the evidence wasn't.</i>

404
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:45,187
<i>And Charlie and I picked up</i>
<i>the pace substantially.</i>

405
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,481
<i>The two of us did nothing</i>

406
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,400
but work on this case for about two years.

407
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:56,073
These people were basically amoral people
who could not or would not conform

408
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,950
to the laws of our society.

409
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,368
But anytime you find people

410
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:04,414
that are unwilling or unable
to conform to the mores of society,

411
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:07,000
you find a person
who is a potential criminal.

412
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,836
[Niren]
<i>Turner knew,</i>

413
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:14,675
"Unless I prosecute it, he stays,
so I'm going to dig as much as I can."

414
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:21,139
If you take three giant steps backwards
and contemplate the fact

415
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:24,768
that one of the most discussed topics

416
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:27,396
<i>of the philosophy</i>
<i>of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh</i>

417
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,649
<i>was his view that marriage</i>
<i>is a worthless institution,</i>

418
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,943
that it interferes with the freedom

419
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,487
that you need to achieve
spiritual enlightenment.

420
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:40,993
And suddenly you see so many Sannyasins
on the ranch getting married.

421
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:46,248
<i>You know, conspiracy</i>
<i>is a federal prosecutor's best friend.</i>

422
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:50,210
The conspiracy was an agreement
to defraud the United States.

423
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:52,880
So the typical case would be this:

424
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,843
<i>Swami Prem Robert, an American citizen,</i>

425
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:01,263
<i>would be ordered to go to Houston, Texas.</i>

426
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,558
<i>Ma Hanna, a foreign Sannyasin,</i>

427
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,603
<i>would be ordered to go to Houston, Texas.</i>

428
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,439
And the two of them would be instructed

429
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:14,151
to go back
to their original non-Sannyasin names.

430
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:18,363
They would each get jobs.
They would get an apartment together.

431
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:22,618
<i>They would establish what ostensibly</i>
<i>looked like a committed life together.</i>

432
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,621
<i>They would go to city hall.</i>
<i>They would get a marriage license.</i>

433
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,624
A few weeks later,
go to the Immigration Service and say,

434
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,960
"We are in a committed relationship,
and under the immigration laws

435
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,837
<i>we would like a green card."</i>

436
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:37,132
A green card would issue. Zoom!

437
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,719
<i>Both parties make a hasty retreat</i>
<i>back to the ranch...</i>

438
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,641
and return to their original lives
and original partners that they had.

439
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,477
<i>And this was done in Dallas,</i>

440
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,729
<i>Southern California,</i>

441
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,064
<i>Seattle,</i>

442
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,942
<i>Trenton, New Jersey, and in Philadelphia,</i>

443
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,652
<i>all around the United States</i>

444
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,655
<i>so that the pattern was harder to detect.</i>

445
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:03,575
This was the largest immigration fraud
case in the history of the United States.

446
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,328
<i>And Charlie and I,</i>
<i>as we pursued the case...</i>

447
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:11,375
<i>the conclusion was unavoidable</i>
<i>that Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh himself</i>

448
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,211
was involved in the planning
and execution of this.

449
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,715
By that time, I think it was
the safe assumption on everyone's part,

450
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,886
including the Rajneeshees,
that if he was charged and deported,

451
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,682
Rajneeshpuram would disappear
off the face of the earth.

452
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:37,025
[Jane] <i>About this time when one was called</i>
<i>into Sheela's room in Jesus Grove,</i>

453
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:41,905
a list was being made
of enemies of the commune.

454
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,117
People were talking
about killing other people.

455
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:51,665
<i>Sheela considered Mr. Turner</i>
<i>a real enemy of the commune.</i>

456
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,042
<i>Mr. Turner had the last say</i>

457
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,671
when it came to whether or not Bhagwan
could stay in America.

458
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,383
<i>When there was talk of shooting people,</i>

459
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:05,012
Sheela had said,
"Shanti B will do it. She's a good shot."

460
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:11,143
<i>It was just put out there that,</i>
<i>"Okay, I'm the good shot. I'll do that."</i>

461
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:17,524
<i>Sheela told me I was to go to Portland</i>

462
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,568
<i>and meet up with a woman there.</i>

463
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:24,698
And when I met her, she was a Sannyasin,

464
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,533
but wearing regular street clothes.

465
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:33,081
<i>And she took me with her</i>
<i>to an apartment in Portland</i>

466
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,500
which she told me was a safe house.

467
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:39,880
In the apartment, the cupboards
were full of regular street clothes,

468
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:44,176
and she told me to choose
from these clothes something to wear.

469
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:49,681
Somebody came to us and told us what kind
of guns he thought we should get.

470
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,934
He said we should get smaller guns.

471
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,438
Pistols because they
would be easier to transport.

472
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:03,195
The small group in the car I was in
drove to where Mr. Turner worked.

473
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,951
<i>And we sat in McDonald's,</i>
<i>early in the morning.</i>

474
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:13,955
<i>Drank coffee. For the first time</i>
<i>in my life I smoked a cigarette.</i>

475
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,167
But we were watching
the park house entrance

476
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,878
<i>where Mr. Turner was expected to walk out.</i>

477
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:25,384
And at that point my companion said to me,

478
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:29,471
"Come on. We'll go down
and we'll show you where he comes out."

479
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,227
And pointed out where
Mr. Turner parked his car.

480
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,981
<i>I was saying to myself,</i>

481
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,943
"What are we doing?
This is absolutely crazy. This is like--

482
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:46,196
We're in the middle of town.
And we're gonna kill somebody here?"

483
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:56,039
No, he didn't come out that day,
so I didn't ever see him.

484
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,793
And as we drove away
back towards the main road,

485
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:04,005
the three people in the car,
including myself,

486
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:07,050
talked about the possibility of perhaps

487
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,678
shooting him there in the park house.

488
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,729
[Zaitz] <i>I've been a journalist</i>
<i>all of my life.</i>

489
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:24,651
I did my first newspaper
when I was in the third grade,

490
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:29,573
and I've done it ever since,
for 50 years in the state of Oregon.

491
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,992
I feel I was born
to be an investigative reporter.

492
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:35,495
I just have a knack for it.
I have an inclination. I can find stories.

493
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:38,457
The best ones are those
that I sort of have an instinct for it

494
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,585
that something isn't right here
and I'm going to dig into it

495
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,128
<i>and I'm going to find out why.</i>

496
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:49,968
We came into it when the controversy
between the Rajneeshee community

497
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,888
and Oregon was ramping up considerably.

498
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:57,017
There were political tensions,
religious tensions, civil rights tensions.

499
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:02,022
<i>The influx of people, the influx of money</i>
<i>was continuing to grow.</i>

500
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:08,528
<i>So the question loomed pretty large</i>
<i>for us, suddenly, is who were they?</i>

501
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:11,156
<i>Where did they come from?</i>
<i>Why are they in Oregon?</i>

502
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,116
And what's really going on here?

503
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,745
<i>I got assigned to go to India</i>

504
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,706
because they came from India
and they left for a reason.

505
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,168
<i>I collected, like,</i>
<i>35,000 pages of material</i>

506
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,629
<i>and established the history</i>
<i>of the organization.</i>

507
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:32,302
It became quite clear
that the commune had fled India

508
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:36,640
ahead of getting indicted
and arrested by Indian authorities.

509
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,435
<i>They were facing immigration fraud...</i>

510
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,898
<i>tax issues at several government levels...</i>

511
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:48,485
<i>the smuggling in currency, in gold...</i>

512
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:53,198
<i>arsons, sophisticated criminal conduct.</i>

513
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:59,955
<i>I spent 18 months writing</i>
<i>what became a 20-part series,</i>

514
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:04,459
which to this day remains the longest
series ever published by <i>The Oregonian.</i>

515
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:12,050
<i>I went down to the ranch, to city hall,</i>

516
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,595
and we asked to see every check
that the city had issued.

517
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,890
<i>It was a spider web of financial contacts.</i>

518
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:24,062
<i>The Oregon operation</i>
<i>had an insatiable need for cash,</i>

519
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,856
to create this illusion
of great prosperity,

520
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,528
that we're building nirvana in the desert.
Well, that took money.

521
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:39,035
I think it became very apparent that this
was no longer a sustainable fantasy.

522
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,124
[man]
You came from where?

523
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:49,337
The honeymoon is over at Rajneeshpuram
between the followers of the Bhagwan

524
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,548
<i>and many of the street people</i>
<i>they invited there.</i>

525
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,592
<i>The street people claim that yesterday</i>

526
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:56,761
<i>Ma Anand Sheela called</i>
<i>the entire street people population</i>

527
00:34:56,845 --> 00:35:00,515
<i>into this large assembly hall</i>
<i>and held a trial of sorts.</i>

528
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,476
[Sheela]
So, what I would like you to understand

529
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,231
that I'm not going
to tolerate problem-makers,

530
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:11,359
any sort of hanky-panky from today on.

531
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:15,697
Tomorrow morning you will start receiving
messages that you need to leave,

532
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,656
you need to leave.

533
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,913
She says, "You. You're on the bus."

534
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:26,374
And the man is immediately escorted out

535
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:30,295
and held under tight security
while he packs his things and leaves.

536
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,881
I saw five or six guys just completely,
you know,

537
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:36,551
like, physically being dragged out,
you know, by the security guards.

538
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:43,475
[Gary] <i>I got a call around midnight</i>
<i>from the governor's office</i>

539
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,394
telling me that Rajneeshees

540
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:51,775
were driving around The Dalles in vans

541
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:55,111
and dropping homeless people off
in neighborhoods

542
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:59,157
and if anybody encountered them
and asked what they were doing,

543
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,662
they were pointing automatic weapons
at them and making them back away.

544
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,039
And she said, "What should we do?"

545
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:13,129
To this day, that's probably still
the most unusual and difficult request

546
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,965
for legal advice that I've gotten
from a client.

547
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,469
Up until now,
most of the folks who've left the ranch

548
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,262
have left of their own accord.

549
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,015
But this latest batch seems
to represent something new.

550
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,560
Rajneeshees are booting people out
wholesale, and they're getting physical.

551
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:31,690
There were people on the streets
that came to our place

552
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,401
that were not in their full capacity,

553
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,653
that really required major medication.

554
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,155
There were people who were violent.

555
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:44,828
There were people who were
really living on the edge of psychosis.

556
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,538
[female reporter]
<i>Rajneesh officials today said</i>

557
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,541
<i>the four men who were dropped off</i>
<i>in Portland are troublemakers.</i>

558
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,209
They call us troublemakers, yes,

559
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:56,297
and we have openly admitted
that we did act out of anger.

560
00:36:56,381 --> 00:37:01,720
We were going to tip
their, uh, ticket booth over

561
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:04,848
and start tipping all their A-frames over
right down the line.

562
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,810
They couldn't control
those independent street people...

563
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:09,811
[chuckles]

564
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,938
...even with tranquilizers.

565
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,857
[chuckles]

566
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,150
They couldn't do it.

567
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,694
Well, I wanted to check it out.

568
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,530
And the guy that we're worshipping,
he looks like a damn devil.

569
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,615
[male reporter]
What would you tell another young person?

570
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,326
Not to come...
unless you want to be a queer.

571
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,164
'Cause there's all kind of queers,
I seen it myself.

572
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,083
They were kissing and hugging,
and the lesbians too.

573
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:36,129
Men are sleeping in this room here
on the floor, on benches, on the chairs,

574
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,758
wherever they can find a space.
They all came from Rajneeshpuram

575
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:43,011
and now they're all stranded
in the city of Portland.

576
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,556
And then they ended up
in towns in central Oregon.

577
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,892
Some of them then later in Portland,

578
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:52,187
where they begged or stole
what they needed to survive.

579
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:57,776
So, it created enormous tension
inside the community

580
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,611
and outside the community.

581
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:05,200
Some residents of Madras, Oregon
say they fear for their safety tonight

582
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,912
<i>as disillusioned street people</i>
<i>continue to leave Rajneeshpuram.</i>

583
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,790
The residents of that town
are being advised by the mayor

584
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:15,126
to lock their doors to protect themselves
against homeless people

585
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,086
who might leave nearby Rajneeshpuram.

586
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,714
Some people had reached
the point of hysteria,

587
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,300
being afraid to go out
of the house, you know?

588
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,553
The people in Madras
are fearing for their lives.

589
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,097
They are afraid that they will show up,

590
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:30,809
and some might maybe even
slaughter them in their beds.

591
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,102
[female reporter] <i>People of Madras, Oregon</i>
<i>have thrown up their hands.</i>

[man]
<i>We don't want them here.</i>

598
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,583
Now what's gonna happen
if they dump them here in town

599
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,001
and they don't have any money?

600
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,003
You tell me.

601
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:04,467
I think it's time
that somebody does something.

602
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:07,887
The release of the homeless people
and how that was done,

603
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:11,641
it was pretty obvious
that things were sort of boiling up

604
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:15,061
and coming to a head here
with this election process.

605
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,273
I'm scared just like the rest of us
around here, you know?

606
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,942
We're just, uh, worried,

607
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:24,404
and we won't know until the sixth,
I guess, how this is gonna come out.

608
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,531
You know, you can only push so far.

609
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,954
Wasco County was looking for a fight.

610
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:36,791
Last night a large group
of angry Oregonians gathered

611
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:40,962
to map out anti-Rajneesh strategy.
Although they'd been warned against it,

612
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,591
many in the group vowed to follow through
with a plan to register illegally

613
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:46,092
to vote against the Rajneeshees.

614
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:49,721
[female reporter] <i>The plan,</i>
<i>organized by Albany resident JoAnne Boies,</i>

615
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,015

<i>the day before the election,</i>

616

Let me tell you,
if you don't get off your duffs,

618
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,731
you're gonna be wearing a picture
of the Bhagwan around your neck.

[cheering and applause]

620
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:04,110
We don't want them
taking over the state of Oregon

621
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:08,239
or any other state in the United States.
This is our country.

I think it showed
they were paying attention to the news.

632
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,151
They understood what was at stake,

633

and they came out and voted
to protect their own democracy.

634
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,741
Sheela's been saying all the time
what they're going to do.

00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,910
You know, and that's-- That's dirty pool.

636
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:57,747
The people don't want the red shirts
to take us over, I guess. [chuckles]

638
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,333
Very important.

Um...

640
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,672
We need the votes for our side.

641
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:10,468
The Rajneeshees were way under
what they needed to do a block vote

642
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:13,262
and get their own people
into the county commission.

643
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:16,307
The problem was that Wasco County
was a little bigger

644
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:21,187
than the Rajneeshees could control
just by sheer numbers.

645
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:24,524
And it fell apart before the election.

646

November sixth means different things
for different people,

647

but today at Rajneeshpuram, its meaning
is being translated into protest.

- ...the Constitution!
- [crowd] Yeah!

649

660

It was misuse of power

Well, although that Rajneeshee takeover
threat never really got off the ground,

671
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,892
it did spur a record voter turnout.

672
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,311
Ninety-three percent turnout.
That is really something.

[male reporter]

Frankly, everyone in Wasco County is also
happy that the Rajneeshees did not vote.

676

We did it, we did it correctly,
we did it legally, we did it properly,

[female reporter]
<i>Officials here share a sigh of relief</i>

679
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:02,622
and a sense of pride
in a community that stood together

680
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,792
facing one of the greatest challenges
to the democratic process

681
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,002
any county in the country
has had to endure.

682
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:11,964
Well, in Sheela's case, um...

683
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:15,718
she did not take losing lightly.

684
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:17,970
She did not leave her guns at the door.

685
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,389
She wasn't calm for very long.

686
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:23,351
She got militant pretty darn fast.

687
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,729
If they want to demolish us,
they can throw a bomb on us.

688
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,690
We'll be happily ready to die.

689
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:35,488
But to become victim
of fascist government,

690
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,449
that's not Rajneeshee way.

691
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,661
It's like Hitler's troops are waiting...

692
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,792
to massacre the Allies.

693
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,003

[laughs] That's the only thing I can say.
It's a rare breed.

698
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,270
[male reporter] Next thing they want
to know is what do you mean by that?

699
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,563
What do I mean by that?

700
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:14,610
They haven't learned their lesson... yet.

701
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,030
By 1984, this whole thing was on fire.

702
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,908
I mean, on fire.

703
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:27,290
I'm sound asleep and the phone rang
in the middle of a deep sleep.

704
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:30,877
And it was my secretary
who had been called and said that,

705
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,753
<i>"You gotta come down</i>
<i>to the planning office.</i>

00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,549
Sure enough, there was a fire.
[chuckles]

708
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,219
What they did was two or three broke in

709
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:43,890
and almost every file was pulled
out of its drawer and thrown around

710
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:48,519
and they cut the candles off and squirted
everything with the lighter fluid.

711
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:52,648
<i>Once it caught fire, everything</i>
<i>on the wall, it was all blistered.</i>

712
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:57,320
One day everybody got a box of chocolates.

713
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,865
A box of chocolates arrives.

714

<i>Dark Secrets.</i>

715
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:06,454
<i>Outside, they look just like</i>
<i>ordinary chocolates, but inside...</i>

716
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:11,334
And it says, "Thank you for your support

717
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,294
to preserve the Columbia River Gorge."

718
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,963
<i>So we open the box</i>
<i>and we start eating them.</i>

719
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:21,135
A day or two later, Bob's riding
in the elevator and he sees Bowen Blair,

720
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,638
director of Friends of the Columbia Gorge,
and says,

721
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,307
"Bowen, thank you
for the chocolates you sent us."

722
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:30,144
And Bowen says, "I'm not aware
that we sent you any chocolate."

723
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,940
They found one candy
in the center of the box

724
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:37,318
with a pinprick in the bottom of it, uh...

725
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,196
that was loaded with something fun.

726
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:43,950
Mike Sullivan,
the district attorney in Jefferson County,

727
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:47,286
almost died, and nobody knew why.

728
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:51,415
My skin was starting
to turn different shades of colors

729
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:54,669
and my lips turned blue
because of a lack of oxygen.

730
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,754
[Durow]
<i>Bill Hulse traveled to the ranch,</i>

731
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,757
and at some point
they offered him some water.

732
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:04,553
Having drunk that water,
I came down with a violent, uh...

733

We almost lost Bill.

736
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,938
And it was-- It was touch and go.

737
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:17,024
People feared for their lives
and there was a reason for that.

738
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:23,155
We in the U.S. Attorney's office
were concerned about our safety.

739
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,450
Two state police detectives showed up

740
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:29,286
and they took me into one
of our small interview rooms,

741
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,622
and they proceeded to explain to me

742
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:33,874
that they had developed
credible information

743
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:36,127
that I had been targeted for murder.

744
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,338
<i>These folks were so diabolical</i>

745
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:43,759
that they would consider killing me
for doing my job.

746
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:47,221
The Rajneeshee rumor hotline has been
operating only since yesterday afternoon,

00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:50,558
but already it has received
up to 3,000 phone calls

748
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,435
from citizens worried about
the Rajneeshees.

749
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,022
State police.

750
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,735
Oh, sure. I can answer that.

751
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:06,490
The challenge was to sift through
what's real and what's not,

752
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:11,704
because some of the things that we
were hearing were just... fantastical.

753
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:16,792
A very strange story continues to unfold
at the Oregon commune of Rajneeshpuram.

754
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:19,920
[male reporter] <i>There's a new accusation</i>
<i>against Sheela and her gang,</i>

755
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,423
<i>and it was a plot to blow up</i>
<i>the Wasco County courthouse.</i>

756
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:26,093
[male reporter] <i>An Air Rajneesh pilot</i>
<i>says he refused a demand from Sheela</i>

757
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:27,928
<i>to bomb a nearby courthouse.</i>

758
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:30,306
People prefer to believe the rumors.

759
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,975
People prefer
not to be confused by the facts.

760
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:36,562
And as long as that's the case, we
will have possible violence because of it.

761
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,147
[male reporter] <i>One rumor claimed</i>
<i>the Rajneeshees</i>

762
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,399
<i>caused the recent salmonella outbreak.</i>

763
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:43,360
<i>Other callers worried</i>
<i>about weapons in Rajneeshpuram.</i>

764
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:45,946
<i>The hotline says</i>
<i>it knows of nothing illegal.</i>

765
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:49,033
The threat comes not from Rajneeshpuram
and Rajneeshees.

766
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:53,621
The threat of violence comes
from these people and people like them.

767
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:54,914
People who are bigoted.

768
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:59,627
And for this court to allow itself to be
degraded in this way is disgusting.

769
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,797
The state of Oregon is dead.

770
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:07,218
[Gary] <i>We had no doubt</i>
<i>that Sheela and her crew</i>

771
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:11,055
were... were very deeply involved.

772
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,433
It's hard to believe
that anybody would do that.

773
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:17,186
And yet in retrospect, we now know

774
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:20,272
that much of what we were hearing
was true.

775
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:28,447
[Niren] <i>We were in the middle</i>
<i>of the battle, but we weren't winning.</i>

776
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,992
<i>Sheela intended to beat the state</i>
<i>and she didn't.</i>

777
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:37,957
She was deteriorating
in a way that you could see visibly.

778
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:43,337
I think the fear
and the anxiety and the tension--

779
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,173
I think it wore her thin,

780
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:49,176
but we didn't know how thin
she had been worn.

781
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,971
And not just parents who are retarded,
teachers-- Uh, students--

782
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:57,017
I saw more paranoia, and not just paranoia
from the people outside.

783
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:59,019
Now it was moving inside.

784
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:07,611
[Jane]
<i>There had always been some tension</i>

785
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:12,032
<i>between Sheela</i>
<i>and the people in Bhagwan's house.</i>

786
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:17,246
<i>Sheela did not like</i>
<i>Bhagwan's personal physician,</i>

787
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:21,333
<i>and Hasya married Deva Raj,</i>
<i>Bhagwan's doctor.</i>

788
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,838
I do know that a problem
between her and myself began

789
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,048
shortly after I married Deva Raj.

790
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:31,343
Something changed,
very shortly after my marriage.

791
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:38,267
[Jane] <i>So, Hasya had even more access</i>
<i>to Bhagwan than Sheela did.</i>

792
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:46,775
For Sheela, this was the last straw.

793
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:52,531
She realized that she had lost the battle.

794
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:57,119
<i>And in the middle of all this,</i>
<i>unknown to Bhagwan,</i>

795
00:49:57,203 --> 00:50:00,998
she had his room wiretapped...

796
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,334
<i>in order to protect him.</i>

797
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:07,463
<i>Sheela would be aware</i>
<i>of any possible danger to Bhagwan.</i>

798
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:14,803
I felt she wanted to hear and control
what was being said to Bhagwan.

799
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:24,146
<i>And we had a tower around his house.</i>

800
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,733
<i>This was where the recordings were made.</i>

801
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:30,694
<i>I would be up there</i>
<i>and K.D. would climb up</i>

802
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:34,907
<i>and take out a cassette out</i>
<i>of the recorder and put in another one.</i>

803
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,410
And then this cassette would be taken down

804
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:41,121
and somebody would sit and listen to it

805
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:43,749
and report to Sheela what was being said.

806
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,420
[Jane]
<i>Sheela played a tape to me</i>

807
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:52,383
<i>that was more shocking</i>
<i>than anything I could have imagined.</i>

808
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:58,264
<i>Bhagwan was asking his doctor</i>
<i>how death could be induced</i>

809
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:01,475
in a dignified, painless way.

810
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,062
<i>Bhagwan's doctor explained to him,</i>

811
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:11,151
<i>first morphine would be injected</i>
<i>into the blood vessel.</i>

812
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,323
<i>curare would be added</i>
<i>that would paralyze the body...</i>

813
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:20,286
<i>and then a third substance</i>
<i>would be added to stop the heart.</i>

814
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:25,416
On the wiretap,
Bhagwan's doctor said to him

815
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,335
that the medications had arrived

816
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:31,672
and Bhagwan told the doctor to bury them

817
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:35,759
<i>in a safe place in the garden</i>
<i>until they were needed.</i>

818
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:42,599
<i>Bhagwan ordered Sheela to arrange</i>
<i>for the building of a crematorium.</i>

819
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:51,650
<i>He also told Sheela that he would die</i>
<i>on a Master's Day, the sixth of July.</i>

820
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:57,865
<i>It was too awful to contemplate.</i>

821
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,993
I didn't know what it meant.
It frightened me terribly.

822
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:04,371
But it was just awful.

823
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:08,500
From that day on, I listened to Sheela

824
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:11,378
when she talked
about the dangers to Bhagwan...

825
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,590
of his doctor and his dentist.

826
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:18,969
We complain about not to use
rats and rabbits...

827
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,889
for medical experiment.

828
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:27,061
And they take this intellectual giant...

829
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,480
for this stupid experiment.

830
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,816
How stupid they can be.

831
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,321
They have no ethics.
They have no ethics in medical field.

832
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,199
They have no human ethics.

833
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:43,660
And definitely, they don't know

834
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:47,915
the relationship of guru and disciple.

835
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:55,172
[Jane]
<i>On the eve of Master's Day,</i>

836
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:57,466
<i>July the sixth, 1985...</i>

837
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:02,513
<i>Sheela called a group of us to her house.</i>

838
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:06,225
Sheela looked terrible that evening.

839
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:10,062
She was really pale.

840
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,523
And she told us,

841
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,901
"Tomorrow Bhagwan is going
to orchestrate his death.

842
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:19,988
Tomorrow Deva Raj is going to kill him.

843
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:23,784
We've got to stop it.
We have to do something.

844
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:27,329
If we can stop Deva Raj,
if we can kill Deva Raj,

845
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:28,831
Bhagwan won't die.

846
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:31,500
Who will do it?"

847
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:35,295
Nobody spoke.

848
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,967
We were all in shocked silence.

849
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:43,762
It was impossible. It was just
impossible that Bhagwan should die.

850
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:49,101
But when somebody spoke
and said, "I will do it,"

851
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:53,730
that was me. That was my voice...

852
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:59,361
that rose up in that silence
and said, "I will do it."

853
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:03,740
<i>And then there was</i>
<i>just general pandemonium.</i>

854
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:07,453
People were all talking at once,
but I had retreated into myself.

855
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:10,497
I wasn't really listening.
I didn't really hear what they said.

856
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:15,335
And after, when everybody had gone,
I went by myself, completely alone.

857
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:16,753
I went to Sheela's nurse.

858
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,132
She gave me what I would need.

859
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:23,385
A syringe, the substance.

860
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:27,931
I went to the clothing room
and chose the clothes I would wear...

861
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,811
so that I had a pocket
to put the syringe in.

862
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:38,317
It was all about...

863
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,945
keeping Bhagwan alive.

864
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,656
Bhagwan must live.

865
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:05,177
[Jane] <i>When I dressed that morning to go,</i>
<i>I was...</i>

866
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:09,431
I was not afraid.

867
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:15,354
I felt very strong
and very clear in what I was doing.

868
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:18,148
<i>I went to the festival.</i>

869
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,820
I felt like a medieval knight.

870
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:26,823
I felt like Joan of Arc
who was going into battle.

871
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:37,960
I sat close behind the doctor.

872
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:50,264
The festivities took their known pattern.

873
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:54,309
There was enormous noise, music, dancing.

874
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:55,644
[cheering]

875
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:03,277
And as Bhagwan stood up to leave,

876
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,822
and everybody cheered
and waved their hands

877
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,992
in absolute ecstasy and joy...

878
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:17,541
I approached Deva Raj
and said something into his ear.

879
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:22,462
And as he leaned towards me,
I pushed the syringe.

880
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,428
He instantly grabbed behind him,

881
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:31,805
grabbed my hand with the syringe in it,

882
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,599
and there was a bit of a struggle,

883
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:37,519
but I got it out again and threw it away.

884
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:40,647
The woman who had arranged to pick it up,
picked it up.

885
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:48,030
I behaved to Deva Raj
as though nothing had happened.

886
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:52,075
I looked at him quizzically,
"What's wrong with you?

887
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:53,869
What are you-- What's the problem?"

888
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:58,081
He stood up, staggered, walked backwards.

889
00:56:58,165 --> 00:56:59,207
<i>I followed him.</i>

890
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:02,169
"What's wrong with you?
What's the problem?

891
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:05,339
<i>What is-- What's the problem?"</i>

892
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,300
<i>And as he staggered away from me...</i>

893
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:12,971
I turned and walked away.

894
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:14,848
I walked through the crowd.

895
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:17,100
I walked out the other side.

896
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:21,730
And I walked
back to Jesus Grove where I lived.

897
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,231
Completely alone.

898
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:27,611
Nobody spoke to me and I spoke to nobody.

899
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:29,404
And I wanted to be alone.

900
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:32,991
There was the part of me who felt...

901
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:35,911
I had saved Bhagwan's life.

902
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:38,330
I had done what I had to do.

903
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:42,709
But deep inside of me, I was shattered.

904
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:47,631
<i>I had grown up clearly understanding</i>

905
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,341
<i>that thou shalt not kill.</i>

906
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:53,470
And now I had tried to kill somebody.

907
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,598
What had happened?

908
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:02,396
I knew... I had gone beyond the pale.

909
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,315
I knew I had stepped over the line.

910
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:11,196
And on that day,
I also knew I had to leave.

911
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:25,085
[Sheela] <i>When you see</i>
<i>some photos of me in last months,</i>

912
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:27,421
<i>I was worn out.</i>

913
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,718
I was totally heartbroken.

914
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:38,306
Every night, my mother would come.

915
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,810
She sits on my bed...

916
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,188
and pours tears,

917
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:47,774
"If you will continue like this...

918
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,153
you will die soon."

919
00:58:53,405 --> 00:58:56,867
I can still see my mother's pain.

920
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:01,329
This was...

921
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:08,587
the straw that broke camel's back.

922
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:12,674
Two days after, I left Rajneeshpuram.

923
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,392
<i>Those last two days...</i>

924
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:26,521
they were full of pain.

925
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:34,237
To leave Bhagwan...

926
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:39,076
a man I thought was unsep--

927
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:41,661
Unseparable from me.

928
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:46,083
I'm taking the decision to leave.

929
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,921
I'm taking decision to leave

930
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:54,883
from all these beautiful people
who love me.

931
00:59:56,885 --> 01:00:00,514
I knew I would be excommunicated.

932
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,142
But I'm leaving.

933
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:11,399
I had learned from Bhagwan,
burn your bridges.

934
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:15,070
Go forward.

935
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:32,462
Sheela and her closest associates took off
in broad daylight aboard this airplane,

936
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:36,216
leaving Rajneeshees to wonder
what other secrets they left behind.

937
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:40,011
Sheela was looking very serious.

938
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:44,015
And I looked around--
I didn't know what was happening.

939
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:45,725
I said, "What's happening?"

940
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:48,270
And Sheela looked at me
and she said, "I'm leaving."

941
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,648
And in that minute, it just came.

942
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,900
I said, "If you're leaving,
I'm leaving too."

943
01:00:55,777 --> 01:01:00,240
Thirteenth of September, 1985

944
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:03,160
was my personal independence day.

945
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:09,249
That was the day I left Bhagwan.

946
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:15,088
<i>The main people</i>
<i>who work with me day and night,</i>

947
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:17,132
they left with me.

948
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:21,761
Their loyalty to Bhagwan,
they had transferred it to me...

949
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:27,058
<i>because they saw genuine loyalty in me.</i>

950
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:29,436
[male reporter]
<i>The pilot who flew them out says</i>

951
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,354
<i>they left with 20 pieces of luggage.</i>

952
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:34,816
<i>About 100 Rajneeshees</i>
<i>gathered here to see them off.</i>

953
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,903
<i>Once in the air, the former president</i>
<i>of the commune was heard to say,</i>

954
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:40,113
"At least we left like queens."

955
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:45,076
[Niren] <i>When I came to work, somebody</i>
<i>told me that Sheela had left the ranch</i>

956
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,329
<i>and a bunch of her people</i>
<i>had gone with her.</i>

957
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,705
And I...

958
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,753
I thought that--
I mean, I was just-- I was...

959
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:58,840
aghast-- Not--

960
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:03,303
I-- I was just in shock that Sheela
would just up and leave overnight.

961
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:05,513
[female reporter]
<i>The commune is rocked by news</i>

962
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:08,683
<i>that Bhagwan's fiery personal secretary,</i>
<i>Ma Anand Sheela,</i>

963
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:11,645

964

[Jane] <i>But once my daughter</i>
<i>and I were on the plane</i>

965
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:19,861
and the break had been really made,
I was overwhelmed.

966
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:22,030
I had left the master.

967
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,241
This is impossible.

968
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:26,284
We were flying away.

969
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:30,830
We were flying to a new life
and we didn't know what it was.

970
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:34,167
Time had come.
I had to go on my own.

971
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,963
<i>I had to figure out life for myself.</i>

972
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,638
<i>And after I left Bhagwan,</i>

973
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:51,351
we never cross each other's path again.

974
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:57,440
The person who was Sheela's secretary

975
01:02:57,524 --> 01:03:00,568
called Lao Tzu house
and made an appointment to speak to Osho

976
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:03,405
and went up and spoke to Osho
and told him what was going on.

977
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:07,701
And he was not happy. He was--
[chuckles] He was--

978
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:12,747
He had vengeance.
He was going to prosecute.

979
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:16,501
He was interested in getting her.
He wanted her caught.

980
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:21,589
And within 24 hours of a lot
of that information coming to him,

981
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:23,466
he came out and spoke.

982
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:28,096
I fully expected the shit to hit the fan.

983
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:32,183
The leader of the sect
is Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh.

984
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:34,644
He has been something of a mystery
to say the least.

985
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:37,188
He has not spoken publicly in four years,

986
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:40,442
but now, for reasons
that are not entirely clear to us,

987
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,193
he has finally broken his silence.

988
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:45,780
And there's more going on at the ranch.
The Bhagwan silence is over.

989
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:49,409
<i>News 8 learned this afternoon</i>
<i>that just two hours from now</i>

990
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:52,329
<i>the Bhagwan will begin speaking</i>
<i>to Rajneeshee faithful.</i>

991
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:55,373
[woman] We're gonna be having
a press conference this evening.

992
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:57,792
And it's going to be with Bhagwan.

993
01:03:57,876 --> 01:04:00,628
We're just announcing it to the press
in case they want to come.

994
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:47,133
[Bhagwan] I have been silent
for three and a half years.

995
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:49,844
The people who were in power

996
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:54,599
took advantage of my silence.

997
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:58,144
Sheela and her group,

998
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:01,398
they tried to kill three people.

999
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:06,611
They have attempted

1000
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:11,658
to murder people in the commune.

1001
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:18,039
They have attempted
to murder people in The Dalles.

1002
01:05:18,123 --> 01:05:22,627
They have attempted
bugging people's houses.

1003
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:25,380
My own house.

1004
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:31,219
These people are absolutely criminals.

1005
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:36,516
Inhuman.

1006
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:39,894
Brutal.

1007
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:45,442
Fascist in their outlook.

1008
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:49,904
On a different level,
the news out of Rajneeshpuram

1009
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:51,698
is getting more bizarre every day.

1010
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:54,617
[male reporter] <i>The number one source</i>
<i>of new rumors is Bhagwan himself.</i>

1011
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:57,370
<i>Just about every appearance,</i>
<i>there's a new accusation.</i>

1012
01:05:57,454 --> 01:06:00,498
A palace coup,
alleged theft of millions of dollars.

1013
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:03,960
The whereabouts of Ma Anand Sheela
are still a mystery tonight.

1014
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:06,629
According to Bhagwan,
it was all the work of Sheela

1015
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:08,965
and what he calls her gang of fascists.

1016
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:13,761
She should have been here and faced me.

1017
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:21,394
She did not even come
to say goodbye to me.

1018
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:31,779
People who don't commit crime
don't escape like that.

1019
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:35,783
How long you can hide?

1020
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:42,457
And if the police
is not going to take the action...

1021
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:47,003
then my people will take the action.
