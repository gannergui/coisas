00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,911
because these people I really trusted

161
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:07,959
and they turned out to be totally
the opposite of what I thought they were.

162
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,130
Shocked, you know?

163
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,506
And even hurt.

164
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,050
It was like, "Oh no, you know? What?"

165
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:20,054
My honest response when I heard

166
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,433
was just the depth of sorrow.

167
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,726
I was so sad.

168
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,104
I was just--
Just even to think of it now is like,

169
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,065
"What happened to these people

170
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:35,653
that they could go so wrong
and be around him?"

171
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,990
That was beyond wild for me.

172
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:44,746
Um... And I also-- I really felt for them.

173
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,874
I thought they had gone crazy. Truly.

174
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,883
As the days passed
and Bhagwan started telling us

175
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:01,679
more and more of the actualities
of what was going on in this community

176
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:06,100
that we didn't know about,
it began to be a feeling of burden

177
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,687
and of depression and sadness and anger

178
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:13,816
and feelings of betrayal.

179
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:20,323
This community is under attack...
from a lot of directions.

180
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:27,080
People who are here
and who we trusted have fucked us.

181
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:32,126
I feel like we have a basic, basic choice.

182
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:40,843
[voice breaking] And that is... do we want
to be here together or do we not?

183
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:51,938
The reaction in the commune overall
was the same reaction I had: relief.

184
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:53,648
This...

185
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,776
Come on.

186
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:01,739
This power-mad, megalomaniac

187
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:08,746
who had been literally hammering
on everybody for a long time was gone.

188
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:13,167
I don't know.
It's like the clouds have suddenly lifted.

189
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:18,881
In some ways, it was clouds
that we weren't even aware of.

190
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:24,345
And... very shortly after Sheela left,

191
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:29,809
Hasya was appointed
Osho's new personal secretary.

192
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,812
Hasya has been chosen
by the board of trustees

193
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,982
to be the president
of the Rajneesh Foundation International.

194
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:40,236
She has also been chosen
by Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh

195
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,363
to be his personal secretary.

206

Well, I think it depends
how they receive me...

207

how they begin to see us.

208

I certainly have
no intentions of harming them.

209

Mm-hmm.

217
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:05,154
And somebody came to me and said

218
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:11,244
that... Osho has suggested
that you run for mayor.

This was the first
of two huge mistakes that he made.

240
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:36,579
He broke his silence and announced to
the world that shocked-- He was shocked.

241
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,248
"Oh my God, I'm shocked.
Shocked, I tell you.

242
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,751
Shocked. I just heard this.
I'm going to share this with you."

243
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:48,049
It was Bhagwan just turning on Sheela
in a very, very public way.

244

after their leader,
the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh,

[Bhagwan] <i>Sheela wanted</i>

against the Wasco County office.

257
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:33,052
She has stolen 43 million dollars
out of that money.

258
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:37,431
One of the offices of Wasco County
was burned.

259
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,768
They should put Interpol after them.

260
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:46,190
They should be brought back in chains.

261
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:50,194
That invited the FBI
onto the ranch for the first time

262
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:54,615

within the jurisdiction of the FBI.

was a couple engaged in sex on a bridge
at the far west end of the community

267

for a very bizarre two months

conducting a federal investigation.

Uh... [clears throat]

270
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:36,824
Sex, uh, between commune members
was open and frequent

271
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:40,119
and, uh, all types of things were condoned

272
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:44,707

out in other parts of the state of Oregon.

00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:53,753
It was a very sophisticated system
in every building in the town.

311
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:58,090
[male reporter] <i>Rajneesh officials have</i>
<i>already uncovered dozens of spy devices.</i>

312
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:02,052
<i>They were apparently used to record,</i>
<i>to photograph, and sometimes to injure.</i>

313
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:10,811
This was the largest wiretapping incident
in the history of any nation.

314
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:14,190
[male reporter] <i>The FBI has</i>
<i>so many tapes of recorded conversations</i>

315
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,859
that it would take one person
working eight hours a day

316
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,195
more than two years to listen to them all.

317
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,782
The tapes may contain information
about other alleged crimes at the ranch.

318
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:28,412
We were focused on assaults,
batteries, attempted murders

319
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:33,584
and everything else
was sort of paled in comparison.

320
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,628
Those with the most serious crimes

321
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:39,757
and they called
for very serious sanctions in our view.

322
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:48,015
[Jane] <i>Before Sheela</i>
<i>had left Bhagwan and Rajneeshpuram...</i>

323
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,311
<i>I was one day told</i>
<i>to come down to the restaurant</i>

324
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,064
<i>and Sheela said, "I have a job for you.</i>

325
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,275
<i>We need some guns that can't be traced</i>

326
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:02,279
and you and Rita are to go and get them."

327
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:06,200
And we took a plane... to Texas.

328
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:12,873
<i>We drove around different gun shops</i>
<i>and bought guns.</i>

329
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:17,211
And each time we came out
of a shop with another gun,

330
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,380
we drove off to the next one.

331
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:23,551
I ripped up the receipt for the gun,
threw the bits out the window,

332
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:27,388
and we laughed and sang
because we were so happy.

333
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,143
I took the guns with me in a bag,

334
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:36,522
and I took the Greyhound bus
back to Portland.

335
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:42,653
I was met at the bus station by a man
who had told us what kind of guns to buy.

336
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,073
<i>He took</i>
<i>the rather heavy bag out of my hand,</i>

337
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,992
and I never saw them again.

338
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,830
[male reporter]
<i>If there is a cache of weapons dumped</i>

339
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:56,458
<i>at this lake at Rajneeshpuram,</i>
<i>U.S. Navy divers say they'll find it.</i>

340
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,377
<i>The weapons were allegedly bought</i>

341

<i>like State Attorney General</i>
<i>Dave Frohnmayer.</i>

343
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,343
According to an informant
who claims to have direct links,

344
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,721
the weapons were dumped here
in Lake Patanjali

345
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,556
<i>when the assassination plot fell through.</i>

346
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:14,393
<i>To aid in the search, divers are using</i>
<i>a highly sensitive metal detector</i>

347
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,896
<i>capable of finding an item</i>
<i>as small as a hair pin.</i>

348
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,984
<i>U.S. Assistant Attorney Robert Weaver</i>
<i>told CBS News that a weapon was found</i>

349
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,110
<i>that is believed to have been linked</i>

350
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:26,947
<i>to an assassination plot</i>
<i>against U.S. Attorney Charles Turner.</i>

351
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:34,038
[Gary] <i>They had been surveilling Dave</i>
<i>Frohnmayer and Charlie Turner's homes</i>

352
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,624
<i>and their families for months,</i>

353
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,667
<i>plotting assassinations.</i>

354
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:43,756
Dave Frohnmayer's young daughter Katie
came home from school one day

355
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,134
to find bloody animal entrails

356
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:52,473
and-- And some, uh, newspaper articles
on their driveway.

357
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:56,977
The Rajneeshees came this close
to murdering a presidential appointee,

358
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,438
to executing Charles Turner.

359
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,482
They came this close to murdering him.

360
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:06,779
If you murdered the United States attorney
or the attorney general of Oregon,

361
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:11,033
that's an assassination.
That's a very high-profile crime.

362
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,952
According to testimony
recounted in this affidavit,

363
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:17,498
all the drugs and potential poisons came
through the Rajneesh Medical Corporation.

364
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,542
<i>The corporation secretary treasurer,</i>
<i>Ma Anand Puja,</i>

365
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,920
had total control of the organization.

366
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,130
According to witnesses,
she ordered all the drugs,

367
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:28,425
often dispensed them, and even
poured the beer for the street people

368
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,594
<i>when they arrived at the ranch last fall.</i>

369
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:33,639
To my mind, one of the creepiest
characters of the whole operation

370
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:37,393
was Ma Anand Puja,
who was trained as a nurse.

371
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,646
This came out admitted,
you know, that that Puta--

372
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,065
Was that her name?

373
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,650
Puja, yeah.

374
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,778
Yeah, <i>puta </i>is something in Spanish
that we don't want to say, huh?

375
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:53,992
<i>Puja used poisoning</i>
<i>as a internal tool to regulate.</i>

376
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:58,163
You know, somebody giving you a bad time,
they get really sick.

377
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,417
[male reporter] <i>Apparently, police were</i>
<i>looking for evidence at the medical clinic</i>

378
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,252
<i>that might corroborate</i>
<i>Bhagwan's allegation</i>

379
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,547
<i>that Sheela and friends</i>
<i>tried to poison Bhagwan's doctor.</i>

380
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:11,719
I felt this sort of slight, slight pain,
slight sort of funny sensation

381
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:16,724
and realized all in one terrible flash
what was happening.

382
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,268
You know, Shanti Bhadra,
the pain in my left buttock,

383
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,813
the whole poisoning,
the whole thing suddenly clarified,

384
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,398
"My God, these people."

385
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:25,607
[gasps]

386
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:29,528
This is unbelievable,
but it's definitely happening, you know?

387
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:36,285
The FBI asked me if I had any sense
that I might I have been poisoned.

388
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:42,207
<i>One day, I was offered a cup of coffee.</i>

389
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:49,423
I drank the coffee and then I immediately
ran to the bathroom and I was just woozy.

390
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,092
And there's a knock on the door,
and the doctor says,

391
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:55,387
"There's an ambulance coming!
Are you okay? Unlock the door!"

392
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,682
<i>And then the next thing I know,</i>

393
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:04,104
<i>I'm on a stretcher</i>
<i>to Pythagoras Medical Center,</i>

394
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:07,107
and I'm just out of it.

395
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:11,195
And I just open my eyes
and closed my eyes.

396
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:16,283
And then I woke up several days later.

397
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:21,914
And I start to remember,
"Oh, yeah, Rajneesh,

398
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:26,168
<i>he stopped his Rolls Royce</i>
<i>in front of me at a celebration.</i>

399
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,962
<i>And there were so many roses</i>
<i>on the Rolls Royce."</i>

400
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:32,508
And I said,
"You want me to take those roses?"

401
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,010
So I took a rose.

402
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,595
He rolled down the window.

403
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,347
I didn't even know he knew my name,

404
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:44,436
and he said, "No, Sunny,
you have to take all of those roses."

405
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,443
In retrospect, it's like,
"Oh, my God, she was jealous.

406
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:57,074
Oh, my God, this is just female,
downright, unconscious behavior."

407
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:03,455
Anybody that Osho gave juice to,
Sheela was going to fuck over.

408
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:10,045
And anybody that Osho gave juice to
was going to be attacked by Sheela.

409
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:13,090
I think a lot of us felt this, but we
were afraid to say anything about it,

410
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,051
for fear of repercussion
and what might happen.

411
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,302
[male reporter]
You felt what?

412
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,763
A lot of fear.
I mean, it was like it was never spoken,

413
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:23,183
but it was a lot of fear
that Sheela or whoever at the top

414
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,936
might do something,
might ask you to leave.

415
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,647
I think people were more willing to--

416
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,108
Particularly after the Bhagwan
gave them permission to do it,

417
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,444
were more willing
to tell tales about Sheela

418
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,990
than-- Than we ever found
with respect to the Bhagwan.

419

<i>Then they took the salmonella culture</i>

428
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:07,936
<i>and they brushed it on foods in salad bars</i>
<i>and restaurants in The Dalles.</i>

429
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,608
[Durow]
<i>They had long sleeve jackets on</i>

430
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,819
and they had some sort of system
rigged up in their sleeve.

431
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:19,781
They could just move their hand
over the salad bar.

432
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:23,619
Walked along and sprinkled it
and people got sick.

433
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,707
They were setting the stage
for a big outbreak.

434
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:33,837
The Rajneeshees at that time
were trying to influence the election.

435
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:36,048
The matter is very serious
for the Rajneeshees.

436
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,884
The political makeup
of the Wasco County court

437
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,345
could well determine
the future of the city,

438
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,723
and that means millions of dollars' worth
of investments down there.

439
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:48,393
And so it would make political sense
for the Rajneeshees

440
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:52,940
to want to exert as much control
over Wasco County politics as possible.

441
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:57,778
The idea, it was a dry run
and an attempt to see if, on election day,

442
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,113
<i>they could make enough people sick</i>

443
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:04,034
<i>that they would have sufficient votes</i>
<i>to control the county.</i>

444
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:11,708
The salad bars, uh,
weren't their first attempt.

445
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:17,965
[Durow] <i>There was a threat</i>
<i>to poison the city's water supply.</i>

<i>Most of the water for The Dalles</i>
<i>comes off of Mount Hood drainage.</i>

<i>And we have a big dam... and it's open.</i>

449
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,650
Someone had read somewhere

450
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:42,155
<i>that beavers were</i>
<i>a particularly bad source of bacteria,</i>

453

00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,960
only to discover
that there was just a small gap

455
00:29:55,043 --> 00:30:01,300
between the solid lid and the wall
that was covered with wire mesh.

456
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,886
So they couldn't get the beavers
into the water supply.

457
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,224
So they went back,
and they killed the beavers.

458
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:12,185
And they put them in blenders,
and they blended the beavers...

459
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:17,399
and then poured the blended beavers
into the water supply.

460
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,862
I have no idea
whether that's a true story,

461
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,490
but it's a story that was told to me
by someone who was there.

462
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,286
These people are crazy.

463
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:33,665
This made me a lot more suspicious

464
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:37,336
of what goes on
and what people are capable of doing.

465
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,589
Weaver stood before an empty House

466
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,383
<i>to say he was right all along</i>
<i>about the Rajneeshees.</i>

467
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:48,180
When it finally came out
that I was right and had won,

468
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,140
I was exhilarated.

469
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,558
I was a hero.

470
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:57,272
I'd go speak to the Rotary, and I'd get
standing ovations from Republicans.

471
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,857
[laughs]

472
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,028
Three, two, one.

473
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:06,615
Here's a point to remember:
all of the accusations of wrongdoing

474
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,534
have come from either Bhagwan
or others who have remained in the fold.

475
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,411
<i>This raises the possibility</i>

476
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:14,873
<i>the enlightened master who claims</i>
<i>to have been duped by his subordinates</i>

477
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:18,001
may have to show that his own hands
are clean in a court of law.

478
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,504
It's a very tumultuous time.

479
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:24,633
<i>The leaving of Sheela</i>
<i>and the willingness of Bhagwan</i>

480
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:31,014
to expose all
of the illegal activities very quickly,

481
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:34,726
in my mind's eye,
is just fueling the efforts

482
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:40,982
<i>by the INS and various government agencies</i>
<i>to get Bhagwan out of the country...</i>

483
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,695
and to cause
the breakdown of the community.

484
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,739
The honeymoon didn't last for long.

485
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:51,368
Years of mistrust on both sides
couldn't be erased overnight,

486
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,995
and it became clear
that some people still at the ranch

487
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,373
might be vulnerable to prosecution.

488
00:31:56,456 --> 00:32:00,001
So the Rajneeshees, never known
for tossing self-interest aside,

489
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,795
started looking out for number one.

490
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:06,550
I don't think there was ever
a time in the investigation

491
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:10,679
that I would describe
Rajneesh authorities as being cooperative.

492
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,641
It was
a contentious relationship at all times.

493
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,561
They weren't just investigating
his crimes.

494
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:22,190
They were trying to amass evidence where
they could prosecute people on the ranch,

495
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,483
not just for Sheela's crimes,

496
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:27,320
but support their lawsuits
and their cases.

497
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:32,159
So at that point, everybody that talked
to them starting having to have a lawyer.

498
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,161
The cooperation became more limited

499
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,830
when it was clear
that they were out to use it to get us.

500
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:41,626
[Gary] <i>Being invited down to see</i>
<i>what they wanted us to see</i>

501
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:46,548
did not cause us to just accept
at face value what they were telling us.

502
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:51,845
And so, we didn't just assume that what
they were giving us was the full story.

503
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:58,059
We just weren't ready
to give the Bhagwan a complete pass.

504
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,525
[Niren]
<i>Now, to be clear...</i>

505
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:11,573
<i>Osho knew nothing about the criminal stuff</i>
<i>that was going on.</i>

506
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:16,286
When it was something about his teaching
or his work, then he was boom.

507
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:21,249
But when it was something
involving something outside of that...

508
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:26,046
he always really supported
the people he put in charge.

509
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:30,383
His agenda, as I understood him,

510
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:34,471
was simply to raise
the consciousness of humanity.

511
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,848
That was his goal. That was his effort.

512
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:39,392
That was his only reason for speaking.

513
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,645
For Osho, all of this was a game.

514
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:47,025
All of this was a game of consciousness
to transform consciousness.

515
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:49,819
<i>There was a guy named Gurdjieff...</i>

516
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,657
<i>who was a famous mystic...</i>

517
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:58,119
<i>who would create what he called devices.</i>

518
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:03,333
<i>And he put people in difficult</i>
<i>psychological or physical situations.</i>

519
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,545
And by facing these situations,

520
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:12,008
people would be forced into themselves
and learn about themselves.

521
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:19,057
In some ways, the whole thing for Osho
was a big Gurdjieffian device.

522
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,893
It was a device
for the United States of America,

523
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,687
for them to see who they were.

524
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,648
It was a device
for Sheela to see who she was.

525
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,984
It was a device
for all of us in the community

526
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,611
to see what we would do under pressure.

527
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:37,117
America is certainly the very hope...

528
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,454
for the whole world.

529
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:48,128
But... not the way it is now.

530
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:51,673
We have to deprogram America...

531
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,928
from dirty politics...

532
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:00,515
from fanatic religions...

533
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:11,276
from all kinds of hypocrisy.

534
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,029
It is not a coincidence...

535
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:19,826
that suddenly we have landed here.

536
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,370
We have to do...

537
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:30,462
something really great...

538
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,507
for humanity's sake.

539
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,475
Gurdjieff was right.

540
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,102

00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,739
We had to eat
and we had to have accommodation.

607
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:50,865
We had to have clothing to wear.

608
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:54,535
These are half-trousers.
We don't need half trousers.

609
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:55,662
We need something--

610
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:57,455
Person like me...

611
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,250
who did management of people...

612
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,922
in Rajneeshpuram I could do anything.

613
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:09,884
I can move mountains. I can build houses.

614
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:12,762
But in real world...

615
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,557
I didn't know how to do it.

616
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,936
We were 25 people.

617
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:23,022
We had rented out this whole pension...

618
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,985
<i>and money was needed.</i>

619
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:35,535
We had not informed any newspapers
or anybody where we were.

620
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:39,330
Sheela was contacted by <i>Stern </i>magazine,

621
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:42,166
<i>which is</i>
<i>a very popular magazine in Germany.</i>

622
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:50,758
And <i>Stern </i>magazine paid
a large sum of money for exclusive story.

623
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:54,178
We were not to speak
to the press for any reason.

624
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:57,974
The reporters from <i>Stern </i>magazine
arranged for the whole group around Sheela

625
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:01,102
<i>to be smuggled out</i>
<i>in covered horse and buggy</i>

626
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:04,022
<i>to be taken by bus</i>

627
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:08,234
<i>and then by boat</i>
<i>to an island in the North Sea.</i>

628
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:15,116
<i>We were housed in a very nice hotel</i>
<i>until the </i>Stern <i>story came out.</i>

629
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,409
The story broke.

630
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,080
[Jane]
<i>Sheela posed naked for them on the bed.</i>

631
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:28,171
And I am also in that picture
as one of her "bodyguards."

632
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:35,595
<i>Stern </i>magazine sold so many copies.

633
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,638
You have no idea.

634
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:40,683
And when it was all but done...

635
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,978
we looked out of the window one day

636
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:47,565
<i>to see a swarm of reporters</i>
<i>outside the hotel.</i>

637
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,650
<i>Moments of panic.</i>

638
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,736
<i>They found out where Sheela was.</i>

639
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:55,156
[male reporter] <i>Her whereabouts in Europe</i>
<i>had been unknown until recently.</i>

640
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,908
<i>However, she has been located</i>

641
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:00,620
<i>and is staying on the island of Juist</i>
<i>off the coast of Germany.</i>

642
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:05,124
<i>She's quoted in </i>Stern <i>magazine</i>
<i>as saying Rajneesh's charges are nonsense.</i>

643
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,376
<i>She added</i>
<i>that the reason she left the ranch</i>

644
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,088
<i>was that she no longer wanted</i>
<i>to take bread out of people's mouths</i>

645
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:12,048
<i>to buy him Rolls Royces.</i>

646
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:17,804
I wonder if any agency, federal or
locally, is trying to extradite Sheela?

647
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,223
I have talked
with the U.S. Justice Department.

648
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:24,727
They say nothing currently
has been filed in terms of an extradition

649
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:27,021
and they won't really comment
much beyond that.

650
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,198
[Durow] <i>I recall sitting</i>
<i>in my office one day,</i>

651
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,659
<i>and the phone rang and I answered it</i>

652
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,994
and it was the FBI.

653
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:44,831
They said, "You need to go
to the nearest phone booth

654
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:47,041
and call me back at this number."

655
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,335
And at first I thought--
You know, I was paranoid.

656
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,503
[chuckles]

657
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:53,256
Is this some-- Is this, you know,
another trick of the Rajneesh?

658
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,423
What is this about?

659
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:57,260
It was like, you know,
a 007 movie or something.

660
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,138
So I got in the car,
drove to the nearest phone booth,

661
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:01,639
dialed the number, talked to the guy.

662
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:06,602
<i>He told me about the investigation,</i>
<i>and they were preparing search warrants.</i>

663
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:12,066
<i>And they wanted me to bring down</i>
<i>whatever maps I had of the ranch,</i>

664
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,735
<i>whatever physical layout,</i>

665
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:19,448
<i>descriptions I could bring to help them</i>
<i>identify particular buildings.</i>

666
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:24,453
Took all of that to Madras and met
with the FBI there and the state police.

667
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:31,794
<i>Took some time to go over these drawings</i>
<i>and find out which buildings were which</i>

668
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:35,339
and what we thought
they were being used for,

669
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:40,928
and it was very shortly after that
that, uh, the raid happened.

670
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:42,763
Dozens of federal and state police

671
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:45,558
swept through Rajneeshpuram
this afternoon with search warrants.

672
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,394
[male reporter] <i>Shortly after 2:00 p.m.,</i>
<i>police made their move.</i>

673
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:51,856
They orchestrated very carefully
a raid into the ranch.

674
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,066
They drove down that one road in there

675
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,527
in a caravan
of federal and state officials

676
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:57,778
and then they just fanned out.

677
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:00,823
[male reporter] <i>Some fifty FBI agents,</i>
<i>state and local police</i>

678
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,325
<i>swarmed through the ranch.</i>

679
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,911
<i>The Rajneesh medical clinic</i>
<i>was among seven buildings</i>

680
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:06,245
<i>where search warrants were served.</i>

681
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:08,748
Crimes of conspiracy, attempted murder,

682
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,292
assault in the first degree,
third and fourth degree...

683
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,294
They were able to get a search warrant...

684
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:18,841
<i>and that</i>
<i>really opened the door to Bhagwan.</i>

685
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:22,511
It was like a feeding frenzy.

686
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:24,847
It's like, "Now we've got him!" You know?

687
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:27,058
Get the light out of my face please.

688
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,226
You're impeding me, okay?

689
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,811
Please give me a little bit of room.
Thank you.

690
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:33,439
[Niren]
<i>And the state officials</i>

691
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:37,234
<i>were climbing in through windows</i>
<i>and kicking down doors,</i>

692
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:42,907
<i>grabbing all of their documentation to get</i>
<i>what hadn't been given to them already.</i>

693
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,409
We are being treated
as if we are the criminals.

694
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:47,995
We are the ones
who have called in the authorities

695
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,665
to come in and investigate.

696
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,376
The interest is not in finding
the true criminals,

697
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,504
but to harass this community
and possibly destroy it.

698
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:01,050
[Niren]
<i>There has not been a single U.S. Attorney</i>

699
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:04,595
<i>or a single attorney</i>
<i>from the Attorney General's Office here</i>

700
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:07,598
to assist them in the direction
of their investigation.

701
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:12,687
So what we have is 50 guys running around
playing cops and robbers,

702
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:16,357
being sent warrants
from some distant place,

703
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,359
<i>not really knowing</i>
<i>what they're looking for.</i>

704
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:23,280
I don't know if you can call fishing
with a grenade a fishing expedition.

705
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:25,574
The question is
what is this investigation about?

706
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:30,287
They knew that if they could get Osho,
that the community would disband.

707
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:36,794
So they were focusing on Osho... always.

708
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,630
[male reporter] <i>An investigation,</i>
<i>which Rajneeshpuram's mayor says</i>

709
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:43,342
<i>is a smokescreen for federal efforts</i>
<i>to deport Rajneesh and his followers.</i>

710
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:46,595
They had no evidence at all

711
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:51,392
that he had participated
in Sheela's criminal activity.

712
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,269
They had no evidence.

713
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:56,063
[male reporter] Are they trying
to build a case to deport the Bhagwan?

714
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:58,065
Of course.

715
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,653
[Bhagwan]
If they want us to leave this place,

716
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,905
they will have to destroy it,

717
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:09,368
and with it, they will have
to destroy their mask of democracy...

718
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,706
respect of individuality...

719
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,919
constitution for freedom of expression.

720
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:23,215
All that will go down the drain
with Rajneeshpuram.

721
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:27,261
[male reporter] It sounds as though
a showdown, if you will, at this point,

722
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:30,431
is inevitable between you
and the criminal investigators here.

723
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,851
You are telling your followers
not to speak to anybody

724
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,395
unless they speak with you first.
Is that correct?

725
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:40,149
I'm simply saying that those people

726
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:46,572
are trying a conspiracy
to destroy the commune.

727
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:51,827
And I will not allow anybody
to destroy the commune.

728
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:57,625
And to my Sannyasins,
I would like to say,

729
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,835
"Now no cooperation.

730
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:05,674
Nobody goes to report anything.

731
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,136
Our cooperation is finished.

732
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,057
Now they can go to hell."

733
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,892
[cheering and applause]

734
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,106
[male reporter]
Despite the statement by the Rajneesh,

735
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:22,191
Sannyasins are continuing
to be interviewed

736
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:26,028
by the FBI, the Oregon State Police,
and Wasco County authorities

737
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:28,197
here at this farmhouse on the commune.

738
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:34,787
We wanted some disaffected Sannyasin
to be in a position

739
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:38,415
where they could and would testify
against the Bhagwan.

740
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:48,592
[Zaitz] <i>Prosecutors are eager to make</i>
<i>a deal to get these witnesses in-house.</i>

741
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:50,803
So, that greatly accelerates
an investigation

742
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,556
and also provides you
credible information.

743
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,308
<i>If you have someone</i>
<i>who has firsthand knowledge,</i>

"I was in the room when the decision
was made to poison the salad bars,"

745
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:03,107
then that makes you
a very credible witness.

746
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:07,570
None. Almost none were--
Were willing to talk to us.

747
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,531
They might have hated Sheela
and they might have hated

748
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:14,160
some of the people in that control group
that Sheela commanded,

749
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:17,997
but they were still very loyal
and dedicated to Bhagwan.

750
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:25,087
You know, sometimes
it's better to be lucky than good.

751
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,771
[male reporter] What was it like
being back in the hall today?

752
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,982
It's good to be here.
It's good to be here.

753
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,150
[male reporter] Where have you been?

754
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:49,653

making a deal with the prosecutors.

No.

of any of the crimes that Sheela--

762
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,008
I understand
that it says in the affidavit--

763
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:15,179
[male reporter] I know that he said
that you were negotiating with authorities

Not in a physical way,

She was
incredibly abusive to him at times.

778

Just hitting on him, you know?
Calling him a wimp.

779

Really hitting on him.

780

And he couldn't stand up to it.

781
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:18,826
So after she left,
he realized he could go to jail.

782
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:23,080
And I told him we would get him
his own lawyer, you know? We'd pay for it.

902
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:16,011
[Waite] <i>The Oregon National Guard,</i>
<i>both the Army Guard and Air Guard,</i>

903
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:20,724
has a full complement
of most every imaginable combat arm.

904
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:36,073
Well, let us say right now we're glad
you're there and we're glad you're ready,

905
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:37,908
but we hope to gosh we don't need you.

906
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:44,790
The National Guard was mobilized
to several locations around Rajneeshpuram,

907
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:51,588
<i>waiting for the go-ahead</i>
<i>from Governor Atiyeh.</i>

908
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:55,050
And there was talk
that they would not be coming down gently.

909
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:59,596
It would be in the middle of a night
and it would be extremely heavy-handed.

910
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:06,103
These guys thought
they were coming to a Jonestown cult,

911
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:11,525
who they had just established had,
you know, had attempted murders.

912
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:15,654
I'll never forget
the FBI SWAT team from San Francisco

913
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:18,240
<i>had been brought in</i>
<i>to help with this raid.</i>

914
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:20,200
And they happened to be
in a room right next to me.

915
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,244
And I remember listening
to the conversations

916
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:25,497
about how concerned they were
that these true believers

917
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:28,583
were just going to start opening fire
the minute the police showed up.

918
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:35,090
[Weaver] <i>The Rajneeshees were sniffing out</i>
<i>the fact that we were coming to get them.</i>

919
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:40,303
Niren, as I recall, came to us to see if,
in fact, we were going to indict Bhagwan.

920
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:41,763
We refused to tell him.

921
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,099
[Niren]
<i>We had been trying to negotiate</i>

922
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:48,645
<i>a voluntary surrender</i>
<i>to avoid a confrontation.</i>

923
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:53,984
And Turner said, "I won't confirm
that there's an indictment

924
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:57,571
and I won't discuss voluntary surrender."

925
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,281
We didn't know these guys.

926
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,908
We had no track record.
We didn't trust them.

927
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:04,494
And frankly I didn't believe
that they could deliver the Bhagwan

928
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:06,913
because I don't think
that they controlled him.

929
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:11,376
So, no, not for one minute did we
consider agreeing to that proposition.

930
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,086
The decision has been made.

931
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:17,799
The action is underway that the National
Guard is going to be mobilized,

932
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:22,637
that arrests are going to be made
without any attempt to allow or permit

933
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:26,766
cooperative efforts from within
this community to avoid confrontation.

934
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:30,854
They had the indictment.
They had warrants.

935
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,690
They had everything.
They were ready to arrest the next day.

936
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:37,986
And yes...

937
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:42,908
Are you asking me whether we had created
a dangerous situation for that arrest?

938
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:45,076
I think so.

939
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,746
And I had gone to bed the night before

940
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:50,790
very fearful
about what was going to take place.

941
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:54,085
I would bet there's going to be some kind
of an armed confrontation out there.

942
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:56,796
There's no doubt in my mind
that it's going to be

943
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,090
a mass death situation.

944
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:04,221
[chatter over police radio]

945
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:12,562
An assault was forthcoming.

946
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:21,404
[Bowerman] <i>Tom Casey worked</i>
<i>for the Immigration Service.</i>

947
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:25,075
<i>So he asked those of us</i>
<i>that lived around here</i>

948
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:28,912
anytime we saw something unusual
to give him a call.

949
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:33,792
<i>And I'm riding horseback</i>
<i>up the road with a little bunch of cows...</i>

950
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:41,132
and two Learjets
flew into the Rajneesh ranch.

951
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,677
<i>I called Tom and told him--</i>

952
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:49,516
<i>I said,</i>
<i>"Two Learjets went in about 45 minutes ago</i>

953
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,642
and they just left."

954
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,486
[Niren]
<i>I got a call from Isabel.</i>

955
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:10,453
And... she said,
"What's going on? What's going on?"

956
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:13,748
And I said, "What?"
She said, "Don't lie to me."

957
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:18,878
And I said, "Isabel, what's happening?
I don't know what you're talking about."

958
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:20,297
I got a call

959
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:23,675
from the special agent in charge
of the Customs Service, Larry LaDage.

960
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:26,553
He had a informant on the ranch.

961
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:31,599
Two Learjets had landed on their strip
and quickly loaded up and took off.

962
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:33,768
And while the informant was not certain,

963
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:36,604
he suspected that one of them
was the Rajneesh.

964
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:40,608
And she said,
"Osho just came down to the airfield

965
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:43,361
and got on a plane and left the ranch."

966
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:47,324
And I said, "Oh, shit.

967
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,579
That's not a good idea."

968
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,247
[chuckles]

969
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:56,291
Uh... uh...

970
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:01,171
Well, I was surprised,

971
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:04,090
but then I saw opportunity.
