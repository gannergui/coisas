[Silvertooth] <i>I was walking down</i>

00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,952
and standing out
in the middle of the street,

5
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,120
<i>kind of slight built guy...</i>

6
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,292

7
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,295
<i>You could spot Europeans by the shoes.</i>

8
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:49,883
<i>They were fashionable leather shoes,</i>
<i>not cowboy boots.</i>

9
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:56,306
He said, "Do you live here?"
And I said, "Yes, I live here."

10
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,017
And he says, "They are coming.

<i>Others are going to be here."</i>

12

There's going to be many people here."

14
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,197
And it sounded kind of incredulous.

15
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:17,786
Who would expect that, you know,
it could unfold the way it unfolded?

16
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:23,750
You couldn't imagine that,
in your dreams, initially, you know?

17
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:28,630
Far scarier than anybody
could have ever imagined.

18
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:49,776
Antelope was a quiet little spot
in the middle of nowhere.

[helicopter whirring]

20
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:56,617
Pretty much isolated from everything.

[gunshot]

23
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:15,469
<i>...just a sleepy little old town</i>

24
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,971
And it was just small, quiet.

25
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,307
<i>Had a post office.</i>

26
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,436
<i>The store.</i>

27
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,816
<i>The old school house.</i>

28
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,864
<i>And the old church that was in Antelope.</i>

29
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,663
Antelope, it's definitely quiet.

30
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:56,468
Everybody in Antelope
knows everybody else.

31
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:00,430
And everybody got along
and everybody helped one another.

32
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:06,478
<i>There were community barbecues and</i>
<i>community Christmas parties and whatnot.</i>

33
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:12,943
It was pretty much
working class people that had retired

34
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,780
<i>and for the first time found</i>
<i>a house they could afford to own.</i>

35
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,662

36
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:28,708
<i>...and enjoy</i>
<i>a certain degree of being alone.</i>

37
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,873
There was
a little teeny article in the paper.

38
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,625
<i>It was just about two or three sentences.</i>

39

41
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:21,052

43
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,644
I don't know how else to put it.

44
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:34,107
They bought the Big Muddy Ranch,
which was about 80,000 acres.

45
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,820
<i>Steep, rocky, rolling hillsides.</i>

46
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,907

[helicopter whirring]

48
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,413
Out there, there's nothing,

49
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:52,834
just a couple of little old buildings
and 60,000 acres of rocks.

50
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,463
People had no idea, you know,
what they were really doing.

51
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:00,592
We just heard
that this cult had bought a--

52
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,552
Or it wasn't-- They didn't call it
a cult then, did they?

53
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,804
- No. No.
- I don't know.

54
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:07,015
A bunch of people had bought
an agricultural commune,

55
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:10,060
which seemed a little strange.

56
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,062
And all of a sudden, the phone rings

57
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,981
and he said, "I'm a rancher up here
and these guys come in,"

58
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,192
and he says, "You do everything you can do

59
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,402
to keep those guys
from getting in out there."

60
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,697
What's going on here? [chuckles]

61
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,247
I thought a whole new world
just opened up for me here apparently.

62
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,002
[Silvertooth] <i>We wondered, you know,</i>
<i>who these people are.</i>

63
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:37,963

00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,757

65
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,261
You know, what's this about?

66
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,639
Right away, they tried to have
all the roads around them closed

67
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,224
so people couldn't come in.

68
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,392
And then you started wondering,

69
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:54,062
"Well, what is it
that we're worshipping here?"

70
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,773
And it wasn't long before the Bhagwan came

71
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,901
and we got to see what it was.

72
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,989

Some of my neighbors
over towards Antelope could see

75
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:47,741
<i>all these building materials</i>
<i>and mobile homes being moved in,</i>

<i>truckload after truckload.</i>

77
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:54,372
And it was obvious
that it wasn't needed to run a ranch.

78
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,596
There were these rumors going around

79
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:14,893
that his vision was a city
of 50,000 in the desert somewhere.

80
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:21,191

with beautiful hairy chest.

154
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:39,170
And then, all I realized

155
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:43,424
that tears were rolling through my cheeks.

156
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:49,555
I saw this smile and these open arms.

157

<i>Roger and I, we married in 1966.</i>

164
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:43,067
And in those days,
where we lived in Western Australia,

165
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:47,280
it was absolutely normal
that you got married and you had a family.

166
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:52,493
<i>So two years after we married,</i>
<i>our son was born, Peter.</i>

167
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,457
But the dream we had been living...

they fall in love,

169

they get married, they have children,

170

they live happily ever after.

171
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,592
Oh, it's not the way I think it is.

172
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,551
It's different.

173
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,388
And I was resentful and I was angry.

174
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,517
Roger and I were having
real issues in our marriage.

175
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,896
I would bottle everything up,
bottle it up, bottle it up,

176
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,690
and then... [imitates explosion]
...I would just explode.

177
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:26,694
I just said to myself,
"I don't want to come to this place again.

178
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:31,073
I don't like this.
I got to do something about this."

A neighbor, a young neighbor,

180
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:37,580
had told me once about a psychologist
at the public health department.

181
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,790
<i>And Roger came with me.</i>

182
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,084
<i>I was very, very nervous,</i>

183
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:46,255
<i>and this man came out of</i>
<i>the little building and walked towards us.</i>

184
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,843
<i>I didn't even notice</i>
<i>that he was wearing a long orange robe...</i>

185
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:55,181
and a beaded necklace around--
I didn't even notice.

186
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,142
<i>He said, "You know, we're going</i>
<i>to make a meditation center here.</i>

187
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,937
<i>This is just small now.</i>
<i>This is just the beginning.</i>

188
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,231
<i>And we're going to do a meditation."</i>

189
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,942
I was like, "Meditation? What's that?"

190
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:10,029
We were invited
into the small building there.

191
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,575
<i>There were a number of other people</i>
<i>also wearing orange clothes.</i>

And there were
very large, um, photos of Bhagwan.

<i>Really luminous eyes...</i>

195

<i>The psychologist, he gave Roger and I</i>
<i>a mask so that we couldn't see.</i>

[man] <i>Dynamic Meditation is a combination</i>
<i>of Hinduism and psychotherapies.</i>

197
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:52,613
He had told us to breathe
very fast and furiously

198
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,532
<i>in and out of the nose</i>

202
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:07,169
In the second part,
we were to just let it all go.

203
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,966
<i>Scream and shout if we felt like it.</i>

204
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,761
<i>Whatever came, we just let it out.</i>

205
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,805
<i>And then the third part,</i>

206
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,349
we were to put our hands over
and jump up and down.

207
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:24,061
And every time your feet hit the ground,
you say, "Hoo! Hoo!"

208
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:28,941
<i>And then the fourth part...</i>
<i>was a quiet part then.</i>

209
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,819
<i>You just get very quiet and still.</i>

210
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,700
But when it was over, I just cried.

211

I just-- That was my release.

212

I just cried.

213
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:47,543
Roger sought me out
among the group of people.

214
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:51,505
It was quite a big group of people,
and he was pulling on my clothes.

215
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:57,178
He was pulling me really hard and he was
shouting, "Come back! Come back!"

216
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,639
<i>But he was just hanging on</i>

217

<i>and, "Come back! Come back."</i>

218

[Niren] <i>First you have to understand</i>

<i>tend to share a bond.</i>

223
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,348
It's maybe like going through a war
together or something, you know?

224
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:46,227
You share a bond of having gone
through an extremely intense experience

<i>where you relate to each other...</i>

that's really sort of beyond family,
you know?

and the best place

for anybody to be born
in the history of the world.

233
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:36,902
I was born in the United States
in the late 40s, after the war,

234
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:40,865
when middle class people finally broke
through and could have a decent living,

235
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,118
Where if you were smart, you didn't have
to have money, you could get an education.

236
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,870
So I went to law school.

237
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,289
And, uh...

238
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,667
I was smart.

239
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,962
And I was aggressive, and I was hostile.

240
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:59,467
And in that arena, for the first time
in my life, it really paid off.

241
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:06,682
<i>I got recruited by a firm in Los Angeles,</i>
<i>the Manatt firm.</i>

Bhagwan was very modern.

Very hip.

He appealed to the intellectuals.

Intellectuals who were tired
of the tradition and mundane lifestyle.

270

00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,062
to go to India to meet Bhagwan.

307
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,564
Some people
who came to the meditation center

308
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:50,859
had been for a visit and come back.

309
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:54,112
They were talking
about the ashram, about Bhagwan

310
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:57,199
and that you could sit at his feet.

311
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:03,539
And I developed this need
to sit at the feet of my master.

312
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:09,253
And at some point I just said,
"I'm going to India."

313
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:13,465
After-- After I got divorced, I really--

314
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:17,177
When I'd get up in the morning,
I'd think, "What am I doing?", you know?

315
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:18,470
What am I doing?

316
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:21,139
Eating too much, drinking too much.

317
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,100
Working too much.

318
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,393
For what?

319
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,895
I then decided enough is enough.
I resigned my partnership.

320
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:31,275
People thought I was crazy
to walk away from the gold mine.

321
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,694
So I went to India.

322
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,912
I remember
the first time I flew into India.

323
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,664
I come off the plane. I'm in a taxi.

324
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,624
<i>It's these two-lane roads</i>

325
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:53,213
<i>and these Indian truck drivers</i>
<i>and bus drivers all dodging each other.</i>

326
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,551
From the very beginning,
I was completely overwhelmed.

327
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,553
<i>So many people,</i>

328
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:03,891
<i>so many different smells,</i>
<i>fragrances, all mixed up,</i>

329
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,601
<i>and noise.</i>

330
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:10,022
[Niren] <i>And there's the biggest slums like</i>
<i>you could never have seen in your life.</i>

331
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:15,193
And in the middle of that,
there is this... ashram.

332
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,114
<i>And there was a gate.</i>

333
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:25,829
When the gate opened
and I walked through with Roger,

334
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,581
it was into another world.

335
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,250
It was really peaceful.

336
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,711
It was very green, lush green.

337
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,297
There were
little groups of people in orange

338
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:40,302
sitting around or standing around
talking quietly to each other.

339
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,554
It was a real oasis.

340
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:47,309
And Bhagwan's house was just visible
through the greenery.

341
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,269
There was a huge sense of...

342
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:50,604
[sighs]

343
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:55,275
"Finally, I've made it."

344
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,946
It was a sunny day, beautiful.

345
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:03,617
There was lots of trees,
these beautiful old trees,

346
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,828
full of parrots,
like thousands of parrots,

347
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:13,293
and all of these people, a sea of people,
walking, wearing maroon robes.

348
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:15,254
But it was a very gentle movement,
you know?

349
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:16,922
People talking to people.

350
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:21,385
People sitting and having a cup of tea.
People hugging.

351
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,887
I just wanted to be there.

352
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:26,890
I felt like I had arrived.

353
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:30,143
I felt like after a life

354
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:35,232
of being somewhere where I felt
I don't belong here... [chuckles]

355
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,943
...including my family,

356
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,112
I felt like I had come home.

357
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,006
[Jane]
<i>Bhagwan gave a discourse every morning,</i>

358
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:46,428
and that was the first time
that I actually physically saw Bhagwan.

359
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:53,518
In those days, Bhagwan wore
a very austere white robe,

360
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,480
long sleeves down to his ankles.

361
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,940
He had a long beard.

362
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,485
He certainly looked the part of the sage.

363
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:07,574
And he came out of that door
with his hands joined in the namaste,

364
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,534
which is a greeting,

365
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:13,538
and moved from the door to his chair.

366
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:18,877
And for me it seemed
as though he didn't touch the ground.

367
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,837
He just glided there.

368
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:27,177
There was a slight movement in his beard
from the movement that he made.

369
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,221
And then he sat down.

370
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:36,395
[distant gentle chanting]

371
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,499
I was leaning up
against the mosquito nets at the back.

372
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,835
[laughs]

373
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,044
I was a nobody.

374
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,715
And it was so powerful
to listen to him and be with him.

375
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,092
It was so powerful.

376
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:11,847
I can't even remember how I--
What I thought,

377
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,683
but I found myself sitting
at Bhagwan's feet.

378
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,060
And then he spoke to me.

379
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,157
I'm not special in any sense.

380
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:34,995
I'm not claiming that I am the son of God.

381
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:41,376
I'm simply saying one thing:
that I was asleep, now I am awake.

382
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:46,006
You are asleep and you can be awake also.

383
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:52,095
I will go on
trying to help people to be awake.

384
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:54,639
The awakened man will be the new man.

385
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:59,019
<i>He will not be Christian.</i>
<i>he will not be Hindu.</i>

386
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,897
He will not be Muhammadan.
He will not be Indian.

387
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,316
He will not be German.
He will not be English.

388
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,819
<i>He will be simply an awakened being.</i>

389
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,532
Bhagwan wanted to create a new man.

390
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:24,127
[Sheela] <i>A new man</i>
<i>that lives in harmony with one another...</i>

391
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:27,297
<i>lives in harmony with nature,</i>

392
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,550
<i>where all nationalities,</i>

393
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,344
<i>all colors,</i>

394
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,387
<i>all religions...</i>

395
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,640
<i>sit together.</i>

396
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:41,686
This new man
has only respect for one another.

397
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:47,359
[Bhagwan] <i>The East has remained lopsided</i>
<i>because of the so-called spirituality.</i>

398
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:52,531
<i>It has remained poor, unscientific,</i>
<i>without any technology.</i>

399
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:55,617
<i>And the West has chosen materialism.</i>

400
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,332
But man is very empty and meaningless.

401
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:07,254
Without spirituality,
there will be no center.

402
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:10,090
Man is falling apart.

403
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:14,636
The Western man... is half.

404
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,888
The Eastern man is half.

405
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:20,642
My effort here is to create the whole man.

406
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,062
[Sheela]
<i>The average guru rejects everything,</i>

407
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:27,607
<i>all material, all sexuality.</i>

408
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,945
<i>In old days, that brand worked.</i>

409
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:35,156
You could sell it off good. Good.

410
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,742
But now we are in a modern time.

411
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:42,497
Bhagwan was... attacking all this.

412
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:48,128
You can be spiritual without rejection.

413
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,380
Now there are two ways:

414
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:53,258
Either repress sex as it has been done

415
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:57,804
by all the so-called religious traditions
of the world

416
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,765
or transform it.

417
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:03,059
I am for transformation.

418
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:06,896
Hence, I teach my Sannyasins
to be creative.

419
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,400
<i>Create music, create poetry,</i>

420
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:13,862
<i>create painting, create pottery...</i>

421
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,114
Create something!

422
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:20,702
<i>Whatever you do,</i>
<i>do it with great creativeness.</i>

423
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,080
Bring something new into existence...

424
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,543
and your sex will be fulfilled
on a higher plane.

425
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,880
It was, for me,
as though a door burst open,

426
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,008
because Bhagwan was very eclectic.
He was very well read.

427
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,677
He was a professor of philosophy,

428
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:42,515
and he spoke about things
I'd never heard of before.

429
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,101
And he spoke
about all different religions.

430
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:48,021
He spoke about Buddha
and he spoke about Zarathustra,

431
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:52,275
and I was very attracted
to his irreverence.

432
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,444
I found that very refreshing.

433
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,821
For me, that was, ah, wonderful.

434
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,365
You can laugh about things.

435
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:01,076
You don't have to cry
all the time about life.

436
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:08,917
He was controversial and very popular.

437
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,754
He had qualities that were immense.

438
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:17,634
<i>When you would sit with him in a hall</i>
<i>with six-- 7,000 people...</i>

439
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:23,223
and everybody in the room
who was open to him is stoned.

440
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:27,519
I mean "stoned" in the sense
that when after the discourse,

441
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:31,314
people would get up to leave and they
would stumble if they got up too quickly.

442
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:37,070
He would channel
this incredible energy into people.

443
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:44,244
[Bhagwan] <i>You have to be given</i>
<i>a safe place from where you can work.</i>

444
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:47,539
A place where ordinary things,

445
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:51,209
taboos, inhibitions are put aside.

446
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,838
<i>And this is only the beginning.</i>

447
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:59,217
<i>Many, many more are going to come.</i>

448
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,468
<i>They are on the way.</i>

449
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,805
<i>The others who will come...</i>

450
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:08,727
<i>The coming of millions more...</i>

451
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,605
<i>Hence, your responsibility is great,</i>

452
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:15,692
because you will be preparing the way.

453
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:20,947
Everybody felt that they were there
at the beginning of the great experiment.

454
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,035
And we really saw it had the potential

455
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,830
to transform
the consciousness of the planet.

456
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,875
We really did feel...

457
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:37,088
like we were the chosen people. [chuckles]

458
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:41,801
We are materialist spiritualists.

459
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:45,930
Nothing like this
has ever happened in the world.

460
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:49,893
This is a new experiment, a new beginning.

461
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,438
And it has a great future for it.

462
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,665
[Jayananda] <i>I had basically</i>
<i>a business finance background.</i>

463
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:19,881
<i>I got a job working in</i>
<i>a international bank on One Wall Street.</i>

464
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:25,428
I wanted to create
this holistic community,

465
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:29,849
<i>and I had wanted to do that</i>
<i>long before I was a Sannyasin.</i>

466
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:33,645
<i>I establish a company called Neo-Balance</i>

467
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,023
<i>to facilitate the flow of goods to India</i>

468
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:42,695
and lay in the basic infrastructure
for that community to thrive on.

469
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:47,951
<i>At the time,</i>
<i>we were coming into the Vietnam era.</i>

470
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:55,750
<i>And what we were being told</i>
<i>by our government, by our culture</i>

471
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,961
<i>wasn't exactly what was going on.</i>

472
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:03,466
<i>We were expected to go to college,</i>
<i>get a job, raise a family,</i>

473
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,927
and people were beginning to question

474
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:10,974
<i>the validity of our religions,</i>
<i>our governments.</i>

475
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,727
And I think that's what
so many of the youngsters at that time

476
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:19,691
<i>were rebelling against</i>
<i>and looking inward to find these answers.</i>

477
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,111
[man] <i>For many,</i>
<i>the human potential movement</i>

478
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,823
<i>is the most significant social invention</i>
<i>of the century.</i>

479
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,742
<i>The human potential movement</i>
<i>has become a business,</i>

480
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,035
<i>an underground religion,</i>

481
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,080
<i>a counterculture,</i>
<i>a grassroots phenomenon</i>

482
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:37,542
<i>attracting hundreds of thousands</i>
<i>of ordinary people.</i>

483
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:43,006
<i>To the human potentialists,</i>
<i>self-realization, enlightenment,</i>

484
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,925
<i>creativity, spiritual development,</i>

485
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,637
<i>this, they say, could become our future.</i>

486
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:53,474
[Jayananda] <i>Osho was part of</i>
<i>the New Age awakening that was happening.</i>

487
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:57,020
And inside of the ashram in Poona,

488
00:39:57,103 --> 00:40:01,524
<i>there were</i>
<i>the most dynamic New Age therapies</i>

489
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,693
that were existing any place in the world.

490
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:11,367
<i>Circulating through India were</i>
<i>these Europeans and Americans</i>

491
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:15,455
<i>who were coming in</i>
<i>to see what the East was like.</i>

492
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:18,207
It's like this, for me,
is my family, my home.

493
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:21,336
It's rich, it's abundant, it's...

494
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,087
There's nothing in the West for me now.

495
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,798
I was studying
other spiritual philosophies

496
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:31,387
and doing the whole Berkeley
esoteric bullshit that goes on there.

497
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:34,057
And then, a friend of mine
came back from Poona...

498
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,477
and I saw so much change in her.

499
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,812
I felt like she had found
what I'd been looking for.

500
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:42,065
So I went to Poona to find out.

501
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,861
[Jayananda] <i>This was providing</i>
<i>a steady flow of income</i>

502
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:50,990
to satisfy the needs
of a very growing community.

503
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:58,873
Bhagwan did understand finances.

504
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:04,587
The Westerner came
with dollars instead of rupees.

505
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:08,675
Meditation was a product.

506
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:12,053
<i>It was the product that brought the money</i>

507
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,890
<i>to do the work he had in mind to do.</i>

508
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,606
I was not a meditator.

509
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,483
I don't have interest in this.

510
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,151
It's not my cup of tea.

511
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,529
I like working.

512
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:33,616
<i>But it was not a conflict</i>
<i>between me and Bhagwan.</i>

513
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,953
<i>I knew his marketing ability.</i>

514
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:40,331
I knew how to create organization...

515
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:45,003
<i>how to create</i>
<i>capitalistic working community.</i>

516
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:48,256
Sheela was smart. She was enjoyable.

517
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,966
She was cunning.

518
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,759
She had a feel for power.

519
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,344
She was very charming.

520
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:56,139
<i>She knew how to deal with people.</i>

521
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:59,100
<i>She knew how to operate a new commune.</i>

522
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,396
<i>And money was needed.</i>

523
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:07,358
<i>We needed housing.</i>
<i>We needed to buy new land.</i>

524
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,198
<i>And I come up with the idea.</i>

525
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:18,786
Here is at least
three-- 4,000 Sannyasins...

526
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,790
and they can loan us the money.

527
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:28,254
And we set up overnight
a little bank with card system.

528
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:32,717
<i>It was definitely a big cash flow.</i>

529
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:40,308
<i>We were floating</i>
<i>several hundred thousand dollars...</i>

530
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:43,603
and that's a lot of money for India.

531
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:51,235
[Bhagwan] <i>All communes in the past</i>
<i>have died because of this stupid idea</i>

532
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:54,614
<i>that you should not create wealth.</i>

533
00:42:55,823 --> 00:43:01,245
[Sheela] <i>Bhagwan's teaching was</i>
<i>we don't have to isolate ourselves,</i>

534
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:04,207
<i>sit in the Himalayas, and meditate.</i>

535
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,668
<i>We should be part of the marketplace.</i>

536
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:13,341
[Bhagwan] <i>Now 1,500 Sannyasins</i>
<i>are working in the commune.</i>

537
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,510
<i>They need clothes.</i>

538
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,803
<i>They need medicine.</i>

539
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,638
<i>They need everything.</i>

540
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:22,725
<i>This commune is going to live,</i>

541
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:26,187
<i>and the only way for it to live</i>
<i>is to be rich.</i>

542
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:29,982
[Sheela] <i>The more we do,</i>
<i>the bigger we become.</i>

543
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:32,318
We were getting hordes of people.

544
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,991
Followers started coming over the wall.

545
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,910
<i>There was no stop.</i>

546
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,166
<i>Bhagwan was observing me.</i>

547
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,753
<i>He wanted to test me,</i>

548
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:56,676
and I never felt that I was not adequate
to say what I want to say to him.

549
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,515
<i>Hindsight, I can say...</i>

550
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,351
he had a close eye on me.

551
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:15,653
One of the first things we did
was to go to the front office.

552
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:19,240
<i>This was a glass-fronted office.</i>

553
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,201
<i>When you came in the front gate,</i>
<i>it was right there.</i>

554
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:29,667
There was a very tiny Indian woman
sitting in a very big chair in the middle.

555
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,961
<i>She was clearly the boss there.</i>

556
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:35,506
And they told us this is Laxmi.
This is Bhagwan's secretary.

557
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:41,429
Being personal secretary to Osho
was more than you might think.

558
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:48,352
Osho's personal secretary was primarily
responsible for administering everything.

559
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:54,942
Role of personal secretary of Bhagwan
is you carried the cross for him.

560
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,527
It's a mad role.

561
00:44:56,611 --> 00:45:01,574
<i>And Laxmi's role</i>
<i>was be Bhagwan's spokesperson.</i>

562
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:07,830
The perception from the outside
was that it was a classless society.

563
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:09,373
But when you actually went to the ashram,

564
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:15,046
you found that there were people
who had different degrees of power.

565
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:20,343
So I went to the office to ask for work.

566
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:25,932
<i>Laxmi had to her right-hand side</i>
<i>a very vivacious young Indian woman.</i>

567
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:28,517
<i>And that was the first time I met Sheela.</i>

568
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:31,395
She said to me, "Oh, you want to work?

569
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:34,649
Oh, very good.
We need a responsible cleaner."

570
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,776
Cleaner?

571
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,362
I came all this way to clean?

572
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:44,283
<i>And cleaning public toilets</i>
<i>was my job for the first year.</i>

573
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:54,293
Bhagwan didn't want people
who were coming for mental entertainment.

574
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:58,464
He wanted people
who can support a community.

575
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:03,469
We amassed in the early days
highly trained intellectuals,

576
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,764
<i>doctors, lawyers, city planners.</i>

577
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:11,519
I mean, our vision
was to create a community

578
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:16,941
<i>that could be used as an example</i>
<i>for what was possible in the world.</i>

579
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:20,695
[Bhagwan]
<i>This will be the first Sannyasin city.</i>

580
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:25,408
<i>Within five years,</i>
<i>50,000 Sannyasins will be there.</i>

581
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:31,288
<i>And within ten years,</i>
<i>100,0000 Sannyasins will be there.</i>

582
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:36,961
[Sheela] <i>Bhagwan wanted to create</i>
<i>a new commune, a Buddhafield.</i>

583
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,881
<i>This Buddhafield was a promised land.</i>

584
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:47,680
[Jayananda] <i>So we were looking</i>
<i>for land that had that potential</i>

585
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:51,225
<i>to sustain a large enough population</i>

586
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,977
and had the potential to grow.

587
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:58,190
[Sheela] <i>We had to have</i>
<i>enough space for 10,000 people.</i>

588
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:03,821
We needed housing facility
and Bhagwan needs to move on

589
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,949
to a different plateau, different level.

590
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:12,621
<i>Bhagwan sent Laxmi out</i>
<i>to look for new land,</i>

591
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:17,543
and he said not to come back
until she has finished the deal.

592
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,379
<i>He sent Laxmi to Delhi...</i>

593
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:22,715
<i>Kutch...</i>

594
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,133
<i>Bombay.</i>

595
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,054
<i>The problem was...</i>

596
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:32,224
<i>it was time of Mrs. Ghandi,</i>
<i>the prime minister.</i>

597
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:38,147
And politically,
we came into this gridlock.

598
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:44,320
They saw us as a threat to their society.

599
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:51,160
[Jayananda] <i>And I'm thinking here he is,</i>
<i>this fantastic spiritual teacher</i>

600
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:55,664
<i>who can't even, in his own country,</i>
<i>be able to express himself.</i>

601
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,501
[Sheela]
<i>It was in Poona time.</i>

602
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:02,213
There was a fundamental Hindu

603
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:05,174
who stood up
in the middle of the discourse

604
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,718
and threw a knife at Bhagwan.

605
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:12,264
<i>Knife didn't hit Bhagwan,</i>

606
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:14,433
but it was a close call.

607
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:18,646
<i>It was clear then to Bhagwan</i>

608
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,857
that now we have to take other measures

609
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:27,279
to protect him,
his ashram, and his people.

610
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:31,033
At that point, I go into his library

611
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:34,161
and get a copy of the Bill of Rights
and the Constitution.

612
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:38,999
<i>The United States gives the rights</i>
<i>for all people to practice a religion.</i>

613
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:44,839
And I'm thinking getting out of India was
something that we should really explore.

614
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:53,848
[Sheela] <i>One evening,</i>
<i>I come out of the shower</i>

615
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,599
and telephone message had come.

616
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:59,019
And I was called to Bhagwan's room.

617
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:10,781
<i>And he said,</i>
<i>"Sheela, you come in the front."</i>

618
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:16,287
<i>And he asked me,</i>
<i>"What do you think about Laxmi?"</i>

619
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:24,336
I said to Bhagwan,
"I don't see a good hope there."

620
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:29,550
<i>Laxmi was not capable</i>
<i>of organizing a land for him.</i>

621
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:35,931
<i>And he asked me,</i>
<i>"Where do you take man like Bhagwan?"</i>

622
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:41,437
<i>So then I said, "Maybe I would know</i>
<i>how to deal in America."</i>

623
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:45,774
<i>It was like he was shining.</i>

624
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:47,860
<i>And I tell Bhagwan</i>

625
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:53,240
<i>it was my conviction</i>
<i>that in U.S. we will have no problems.</i>

626
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:59,747
<i>The Constitution,</i>
<i>I thought, was very sacred.</i>

627
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:04,126
<i>And then he says</i>
<i>"Sheela, I have something for you."</i>

628
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:08,255
<i>He put his hand on my head.</i>

629
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:10,966
I just looked at him...

630
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:14,428
<i>tears rolling from my eyes.</i>

631
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:21,518
<i>And then he says,</i>
<i>"Sheela, you are my new secretary."</i>

632
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,106
<i>And the next thing he says,</i>

633
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,652
"Okay, look for a place in America."

634
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:36,283
<i>It was in '68.</i>

635
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,119
<i>I was 17 years old.</i>

636
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:45,000
<i>Our father told us,</i>
<i>"I am sending you to learn in America."</i>

637
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:47,628
What excited me about America?

638
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:52,591
Everything, I guess, in that moment.

639
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:58,013
America was land of promise.

640
00:50:58,097 --> 00:51:04,061
I was fascinated with the idea of freedom,

641
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:07,856
to see the equality among men and women.

642
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:12,236
And color... was important.

643
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:18,242
<i>In my first class,</i>

644
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,786
<i>in Montclair State College,</i>

645
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,622
I met my husband, Mark.

646
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:25,249
He was not Chinmaya yet.

647
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,004
<i>A beautiful man.</i>

648
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,381
My first love.

649
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:39,471
He had a totally Jewish humor
that used to make me laugh.

650
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:42,141
<i>I would have stomachache.</i>

651
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:49,231
We enjoyed walking on Canal Street,

652
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:50,899
these huge buildings,

653
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:54,862
eating pickles, you know,
from the big barrel.

654
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,989
<i>And I felt so good.</i>

655
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,457
<i>But he was a sick man.</i>

656
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:10,878
Mark had Hodgkin's disease.

657
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,964
<i>He battled with it 13 years.</i>

658
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:21,138
Death was a naked sword,
and it was always there sitting.

659
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:25,059
<i>Night before he died,</i>

660
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,436
I look myself in the mirror

661
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,856
and I suddenly see my face grey.

662
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:34,360
I knew something was wrong
with Chinmaya then.

663
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,822
<i>And I said to Bhagwan,</i>

664
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:41,200
"I think Chinmaya is dying."

665
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,620
And he said, "You feel correct.

666
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:52,961
<i>But I don't</i>
<i>want you to have tears in your eyes</i>

667
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:59,343
because if he sees tears,
it will become difficult for him to die."

668
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:12,564
<i>And I did not let a tear fall</i>
<i>in front of Chinmaya.</i>

669
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:21,615
[voice breaking]
I have not known sorrow as deep as that.

670
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:37,714
Bhagwan told the doctors
to put me to sleep for three days.

671
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:42,636
<i>When I woke up after three days...</i>

672
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:46,890
he says, "This chapter is finished.

673
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:53,647
Now you bury yourself in the work."

674
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:05,951
There came a day when Bhagwan announced
to us, a discourse in the morning,

675
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:10,038
that now enough of us were ready
to commune with him in silence

676
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:12,541
and that he would not be speaking anymore.

677
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,838
Unheard of. Unbelievable.

678
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,840
But he stopped speaking.

679
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:24,386
[Niren] <i>And there's this Sannyasin sitting</i>
<i>next to me in the garden for breakfast.</i>

680
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,930
I said, "How's Osho?"
And she said, "He's in silence."

681
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:30,184
[chuckles] I had come all this way
to sit in front of him and listen,

682
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,435
and he's in silence.

683
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:35,522
<i>And that also meant seclusion.</i>
<i>He wasn't seeing people.</i>

684
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,693
<i>When he goes into silence,</i>

685
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,487
who's gonna speak?

686
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:45,657
When Bhagwan
stopped giving public lectures,

687
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:49,786
I became his spokesperson
as his secretary.

688
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:52,789
Everything was put on my shoulder.

689
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:59,838
We did not want Bhagwan to come
under any direct conflict with law.

690
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:04,635
And this is why I was given
power of attorney,

691
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:08,055
irrevocable power of attorney.

692
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:11,225
One gives such powers

693
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:15,437
only to someone
that one trusts so immensely.

694
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:23,820
<i>I had a big meeting with my team.</i>

695
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:27,157
<i>I declared that we are going to America.</i>

696
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:33,288
I said, "Understand what it means...

697
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:37,000
to take this giant tree...

698
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:43,340
that is in middle of India...

699
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:48,887
spread out his branches and roots."

700
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:53,433
It was massive danger involved.

701
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:57,020
I had to present to these people

702
00:55:57,104 --> 00:56:00,983
what it means to hold your tongues.

703
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:05,153
No one should have
a little bit of idea of what's going on,

704
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:10,117
because if people know, it won't happen.

705
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:14,121
<i>I went to Bombay.</i>

706
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:17,583
<i>I started application to the visa.</i>

707
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,587
<i>I went to Immigration.</i>

708
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:24,840
I said,
"I want to speak to you in person."

709
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:28,594
I can see the paper in front of my eyes,

710
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:33,932
this long telex
where they say grant Bhagwan a visa.

711
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:42,399
[Jane] <i>My boss at the booking office</i>
<i>called to come outside.</i>

712
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:46,653
And we looked at him questioningly,

713
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:51,158
but... we should just stay.

714
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:54,745
<i>And the next thing, the gate opened</i>

715
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:58,707
<i>and Bhagwan's white armored Rolls Royce</i>

716
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,709
<i>drove out of the gate,</i>

717
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:03,754
<i>down the driveway,</i>

718
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,464
and out of the ashram gate.

719
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:12,054
In the four years I was in India,
he had never ever gone out of the ashram,

720
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,889
and suddenly he was gone.

721
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:19,436
And we had to go
in the middle of the night to the airport.

722
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:25,067
We had taken a 747...

723
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:26,902
<i>Pan-Am,</i>

724
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:31,156
<i>and upstairs,</i>
<i>blocked it completely for him.</i>

725
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:36,870
This is this beautiful photo
where I poured him my first drink,

726
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:39,081
<i>a glass of champagne.</i>

727
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:44,836
<i>And then he took the bottle in his hand.</i>

728
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,713
"Now for my Sheela."

729
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:50,968
And he poured me and gave it to me.

730
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,512
<i>And we left India.</i>

731
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:02,354
[male reporter]
<i>The god has fled.</i>

732
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:06,733
It seems that Bhagwan left
the ashram in Poona on the 1st of June

733
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:09,569
without warning
and without saying goodbye.

734
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:12,864
His followers have been given
no idea of his whereabouts.

735
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:15,993
Informed speculation
places him in the United States.

736
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:17,619
So I get back to L.A.,

737
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:20,539
and I didn't know
what I was going to be doing, you know?

738
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:24,626
I was hanging out with an old girlfriend
on a Sunday morning,

739
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:28,839
and I remember I was drinking coffee
and eating pastries in bed with her.

740
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,759
And she brings in the <i>L.A. Times.</i>

741
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:36,596
<i>And there was this big article</i>
<i>by Russell Chandler.</i>

742
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:40,225
Osho was in the United States.

743
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:53,321
[Jane] <i>Slowly but surely, everything</i>
<i>that was movable in the ashram</i>

744
00:58:53,405 --> 00:58:56,491
was dismantled and sold and taken away.

745
00:58:56,575 --> 00:59:01,371
<i>I had taken my children, my husband,</i>
<i>and gone to India to live with Bhagwan.</i>

746
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:07,878
Everything I had known,
my whole world was taken apart.

747
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:13,967
I pick up the phone
and call 503 information,

748
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:19,139
and I said, "I want to talk
to those people in Central Oregon."

749
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,099
And she said, "Hold on, I'll connect you."

750
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:22,267
[laughs]

751
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,395
Everybody knew who he was
and what was going on.

752
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:28,190
And I just said,
"Listen, I'm a lawyer in L.A.

753
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:31,985
I took sannyas recently
and I want to know what I can do."

754
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:35,322
Thirty seconds later,
I was talking to Sheela.

755
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:40,035
And she said,
"Are you admitted in Oregon?"

756
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:41,161
I said, "No."

757
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:44,206
She said, "Get admitted to Oregon
and come up here."

758
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,166
And so I did.

759
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:59,763
Bhagwan, he was porcelain...

760
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,598
very fragile...

761
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,726
very precious...

01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,980
millions of years old.

763
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:16,780
And I was lucky enough
to have the responsibility

764
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:20,117
to transport him
from one country to another...

765
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:22,327
at a very young age.

766
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,664
It was an adventure of my life.

767
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:47,811
I-- Yeah, I felt as though someone
had pulled the rug out from under my feet.

768
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,231
But I was determined to wait.

769
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,941
I knew he would come back.

770
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:58,029
Because if he didn't come back,
what was I going to do?

771
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:00,949
Well, he didn't come back.

772
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:02,951
He didn't come back for seven years.

Rajneeshpuram is a big living opera.

774
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:10,292
Sheela a soprano.

775
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:12,878
Bhagwan a tenor.

776
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:16,256
Rajneeshpuram the setting.

777
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:21,553
Operas are, at the end, always tragic.

778
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:28,518
But there were so many facets,
so many dimensions in this opera.

779

<i>I would like to say, "People of Oregon...</i>

780
01:01:32,981 --> 01:01:38,653
think yourselves lucky
that this opera came your way."
