1
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:28,362
[Weaver] <i>In the U.S. Attorney's office,</i>
<i>all you need to do,</i>

2
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,949
<i>all you ever need to worry about,</i>
<i>is being good.</i>

3
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,954
<i>You have a luxury...</i>

4
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:41,124
<i>of making yourself</i>
<i>the best trial lawyer you can possibly be.</i>

5
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,337
And so if you have it within you,
that is-- That place--

6
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,131
<i>And I'm pointing back over my shoulder</i>
<i>to the courthouse.</i>

7
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,384
<i>That place is the best place</i>
<i>to grow up as a trial lawyer.</i>

8
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,552
That's all I can say.

9
00:00:54,763 --> 00:01:00,060
The Rajneeshee case,
the scope of this was enormous.

10
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:04,481
To move the ashram from Poona,
a small town,

11
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,360
lock, stock, and barrel
to the United States,

12
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:13,156
and in the course of that
commit thousands of felonies.

13
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:17,536
<i>So, our goal was to find out</i>
<i>who the architects of that would be.</i>

14
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,122
Clearly a target was immediately Sheela.

15
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,627
- [man] Did the guru--
- Let me just finish my statement.

16
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,546
This was not motivated by greed.

17
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,090
This was-- This was evil.

18
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,363
[Sheela]
<i>I remember we came to Oregon...</i>

19
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,911
People saw with the magnitude
of the ranch,

20
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,164
what is happening is historic.

21
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,669
<i>It was heaven on earth.</i>

22
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:11,840
It was heaven.

23
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,514
[Jane] <i>I was woken up early</i>
<i>and told to get ready.</i>

24
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,894
You need to go and buy clothes
that will be okay in America

25
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:28,357
like jeans, and still in orange,
but get pants and shirts.

26
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,609
I would be flying on to Oregon.

27
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,945
I didn't even know-- I think
I didn't even know where Oregon was.

28
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:37,115
I mean, I was--
It was all a big blur for me.

29
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,743
It's like this.

30
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:46,375
We're in the geographical center
of nowhere, you know? [chuckles]

31
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,335
It's like nothing.

32
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:54,508
There was nobody else there.
Nearest town was 19 miles.

33
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,594
<i>Village of Antelope.</i>

34
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,765
<i>And there I didn't even see</i>
<i>five people walking around.</i>

35
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,395
[Jane] <i>And when we left Antelope,</i>
<i>this sleepy little town</i>

36
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,064
<i>and started going to the ranch,</i>

37
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:16,738
I was a bit overwhelmed
because it was just so wild,

38
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:20,742
so... rugged.

39
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,452
But vast.

40
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,705
Really wild country.

41
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:35,382
[Niren] <i>I got picked up by a guy in a bus</i>
<i>and drove out to the ranch.</i>

42
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:40,011
<i>It's a really windy road,</i>
<i>narrow two-lane road.</i>

43
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,808
And as you come down,
you're seeing the valley, you know?

44
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,312
<i>And it's beautiful.</i>

45
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:04,703
[Sheela] <i>And I stood over Big Muddy</i>
<i>and you see these thousands of hills.</i>

46
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,372
It was size of Manhattan.

47
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,877
<i>Sixty-three thousand acres.</i>

48
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:16,339
They told me, look as far as you can see,

49
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,634
<i>that everything you can see</i>
<i>belonged to you.</i>

50
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:29,770
It was so clear
we arrived at the promised land.

51
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,690
In northeastern Oregon,
the followers of an Indian guru

52
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:38,236
are now only a vote away from establishing
and controlling Oregon's newest city.

53
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,199
[helicopter whirring]

54
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,161
We decided to have self-government.

55
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:52,542
A hundred and fifty U.S. citizens
can create their own city.

56
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:56,838
This provision...
it's a fundamental right.

57
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,342
[male reporter] <i>One hundred fifty-four</i>
<i>registered voters at the ranch</i>

58
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:05,597
<i>went to the polls and voted unanimously</i>
<i>to incorporate Rajneeshpuram as a city.</i>

59
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,559
In the state of Oregon,
any group of people living in a community

60
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,771
have the right to incorporate.
It's called home rule.

61
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,441
You have the right to create your town,

62
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,735
and it's embedded
in the United States Constitution,

63
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,237
freedom of assembly...

64
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,781
freedom of association.

65
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,953
The first city council meeting
of the City of Rajneeshpuram

66
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,037
will now come to order.

67
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,872
- Great.
- All right!

68
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:31,873
[cheering and applause]

69
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,168
[Jane]
<i>A city was going to be needed.</i>

70
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,713
The community itself could issue
its own building permits,

71
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,924
could have its own law enforcement.

72
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,592
It could be independent.

73
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,054
I'm here in one of the largest ranches
in the northwest.

74
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,139
One hundred square miles of Oregon.

75
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,058
Used to be known as the Big Muddy Ranch.

76
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,102
Today it's Rajneeshpuram

77
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,063
because a prominent Indian guru
and his followers bought it

78
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,942
hoping to turn it into an oasis
for their guru, the Bhagwan.

79
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:03,405
A very beautiful city, a city, one which
has never existed on the universe

80
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,283
where people live in harmony,
people live in love.

81
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,204
Beautiful city, example for the universe.

82
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:16,710
I don't think there has ever been a city
that's been laid out and built like this.

83
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:22,966
A city that would be based on love
and compassion and sharing,

84
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,428
rather than ownership and greed and anger.

85
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,139
And we...

86
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,809
The people who lived there...

87
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,354
actually knew they were building that.

88
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:47,657
I went because I thought it was going to
be really exciting to build

89
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,326
a community from the ground up.

90
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:52,996
<i>We're going to be at the ground level</i>

91
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:57,500
of the most historical community
that ever was in this country.

92
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,879
Well, what we're doing is trying to build

93
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,798
a shrine for Bhagwan
while he's still alive.

94
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,678
[Sunshine]
<i>I was working in press relations.</i>

95
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,140
We were opening our doors to the press

96
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:16,061
because we were proud
of what we were doing and who we were

97
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,395
<i>and what we were creating.</i>

98
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,399
It's probably the first attempt by mankind

99
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:25,153
to put advanced technology to use,

100
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,739
where we could live in harmony
with nature together.

101
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,450
We had a job ahead of us.

102
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,953
Lazy people, we don't want.

103
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:37,123
Meditators... later priority.

104
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,960
Now is the time for work.

105
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,672
[Jayananda]
<i>Knowing many Sannyasins over the years,</i>

106
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:47,342
we knew who we could call on
for expertise.

107
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:54,099
We would bring in experts to instruct,
teach, and develop our own potential.

108
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:58,561
[female reporter] <i>These Sannyasins,</i>
<i>skilled architects, scientists, planners</i>

109

<i>of contemporary America</i>

110
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,024
<i>to be self-sufficient.</i>

111
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,945
Taking the most creative people

112
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:11,700
<i>and being able to brainstorm</i>
<i>and come up with really innovative stuff.</i>

113
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:18,206
We were in a grand experiment to create
something from scratch. From scratch.

114
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,097
It was a huge effort,
especially those first few months.

115
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:39,602
The people who were there
were really very, very enthusiastic.

116
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,354
They were ready to do anything.

117
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,941
We worked day and night, in three shifts,

118
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,695
<i>four shifts, whatever it required.</i>

119
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,991
We just constructed, constructed
till body got tired.

120
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,578
People were working their asses off
and were happy.

121
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:03,543
<i>People were working their asses off</i>
<i>and are all laughing and joking.</i>

122
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:09,132
<i>If they worked a 16-hour day,</i>
<i>nobody complained.</i>

123
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,633
There was nothing, you know--

124
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,094
Like we're doing something
really great here.

125
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:16,097
Construction here at Rajneesh
is marching full steam ahead.

126
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,516
Roughly a hundred
of the Bhagwan's followers now toil,

127
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,560
they call it worship, from dawn to dusk.

128
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,188
If you can imagine building a city,

129
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,981
we built everything
you would have to build.

130
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,108
We built infrastructure.

131
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:30,236
We built our own electric power

132
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,864
that would be sufficient
for 10,000 people.

133
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,618
[Niren]
<i>Put in plumbing,</i>

134
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,788
<i>pipes going all over the ranch.</i>

135
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,087
There was a huge push to put in roads.

136
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,883
[Niren]
<i>They were the biggest bulldozers made.</i>

137
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:57,639
<i>You see these guys get on the D-9's</i>
<i>and push tons and tons of earth.</i>

138
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,102
They're actually up there like this,

139
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,772
<i>carving away at the side of the canyon.</i>

140
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,401
I mean, it scared the shit out of me.

141
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:17,200
The women had a very special part
in building Rajneeshpuram.

142
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:23,832
<i>They felt they are equal to the men</i>
<i>and they want to also be a truck driver.</i>

143
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,545
They enjoyed
getting into the mud and dirt.

144
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,590
Hi, Mom.

145
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,385
[Niren] <i>It was city planning</i>
<i>on a level that nobody had ever seen,</i>

146
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,680
to build something of this size and scope.

147
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:47,313
The work was going beautifully.

148
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,486
I couldn't believe it,
because where before there'd be nothing,

149
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,030
now there were whole settlements.

150
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,283
We built small A-frames.

151
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,082
And then a shopping center was built.

152
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,922
[Niren]
<i>We had a banking operation.</i>

153
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,550

00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,646
<i>There was a meditation hall.</i>

<i>It could hold 10,000 people.</i>

158
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,237
We built our own airport.

159
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,580
We built a very big dam.

160
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,001
It is a monument we created there.

161
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:39,759
And you feel so good being young
and seeing that you're doing something

162
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,304
that is so creative, so constructive.

[laughing]

164
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,600
We feel so proud
that we had all this done.

165

I say this is Shangri-la
that everyone dreamt of.

<i>Everybody wanted</i>

<i>the ranch, it was all... not usable land.</i>

172
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:24,554
So, in addition to all the building,
we built the farms.

173
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:31,436
It was the cutting-edge
of environmentally conscious,

174
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,566
land reclamation,
low water use, intelligent farming.

175
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,373
We wanted to take land
that had been abused,

176
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,584
that had been neglected, and reclaim it.

177
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:59,505

[Niren]

180
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:19,442
We could heal the land. We could
feed the people in a holistic fashion.

[Niren] <i>We completely rebuilt</i>

We were literally turning
the desert green.

188

And as it was recovered,
wildlife were coming back

We make this land alive

They should have offered us a Nobel Prize.

I felt so proud of not just me,
proud of whole community.

194

That we could present this to Bhagwan.

195
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,368

And the people at the ranch

200
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,726
they want to make sure it is spotless.

201
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:24,317
We brought animals, like peacocks.

<i>Little music welcome.</i>

203

It was like a beautiful Fellini movie.

00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:59,101
And Bhagwan comes
and he sits in his chair.

205

<i>Looking at the people in silence...</i>

206

And to see this Bhagwan smile
and his beard flowing in the wind...

207
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:39,809
Such a-- Such a reflection of love

A bad sign, let's put it like that.

It just didn't seem right.

217
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,167

that we referred to as "the look."

cross your arms,

and that throws a signal to them
that it's not going to work.

224
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,444
And it worked pretty good.

some concerns amongst the locals.

whatever the people that are involved
in that marriage wants it to be.

that we might have a city out there.

conservative Christian people.

Okay, Margaret. Come ahead.

270
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,977
The position of mayor in Antelope
was just who got stuck with it.

271
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:55,147
It passed through everybody because
there was nothing happening in Antelope.

272
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:58,108
It just happened that Margaret Hill
happened to be in the hot seat

273
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,735
when all this nonsense started.

274
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:05,407
When they first came,
they were truly welcomed to the community.

275
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:12,873
They were different, and anyone
who's different is looked at a lot.

276
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,626
Uh, we were interested in them,

277
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:21,006
but basically it wasn't until they really
started throwing their weight around.

278
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,093
It's not a pleasant experience at all.

279
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,179
She was strong enough
to stand up to somebody

280
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,306
and it definitely turned out
to be necessary.

281
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,600
She was the right person,

282
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,520
but she was real close
to being overwhelmed real quick too.

283
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,688
Oh, yes.

284
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,732
Should some--
a group of people of like persuasion

285

be allowed to enter an area

286
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,989
and literally wipe out
the culture that is there?

287
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:49,368
I was talking with Margaret and she said,
"How come you're not doing anything?"

288
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,580
And Kelly and I just kind of
sat back thinking,

289
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:56,417
"Well, you know, we don't know
what's going on yet... Nothing much...

290
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,835
We'll just wait and see."

291
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,921
Margaret said, "Come by.
I wanna show you what I've got."

292
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:04,216
And I read through literature
that she had about them,

293
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,010
articles that she had about them,

294
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,429
and letters from various people talking

295
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,931
about what had happened
with their children.

296
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,058

304
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,036
the so-called therapy,
which took many forms

305
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,956
and which resulted in some broken bones
and black eyes and this kind of thing,

306
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,792
according to the press and the letters
which I received.

307
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:42,087
One of the things that has--
We have found most irritating

308
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:45,382
is their habit
of not really telling the truth.

309
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:48,010
Even though you catch them in a lie,

310
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:52,056
they very blandly act
as if nothing had happened.

311
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,184
They felt that we weren't real smart.

312
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:59,480
We weren't very well educated
and they were going to show us

313
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:03,108
what would be the perfect society,
so to speak.

314
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,903
They just assumed they were moving in
with a bunch of yokels

315
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,365
that wouldn't know anything,
wouldn't be able to figure a thing out

316
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,158
and they were just so much
smarter than what they were.

317
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,870
There's a difference between being
real smart and having common sense.

318
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,165
They were educated
beyond their intelligence.

319
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,501
People were more resilient

320
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:25,339
and a little more apt to understand what
was going on than what they expected.

<i>Being in the Department of Justice,</i>

324

The work we were doing
was really God's work.

325
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,023
It was important,

326
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:50,030
and we believed that
that kind of government service was noble.

327
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,450
This was in-- In--

328
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:56,954
You know, Jonestown
had happened not that long ago,

329
00:24:57,413 --> 00:25:00,874
and we openly worried

330
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:05,379
about whether
a Jonestown-type event was possible

331
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:09,591
because when people
completely surrender their free will

332
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:14,346
to some leader like the Bhagwan, uh...

333
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,349
it opens the prospect

334
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:22,479
that they can do things
that seem completely inexplicable.

335
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,732
We were worried about that.

352
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,659
Tonight we have a story
about a cult and one of its followers

00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:20,496
that in an eerie,
and some may find frightening, way

354

began with the Jonestown massacre.

355
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,000
[woman reporter]
<i>One of the mourners at Ryan's funeral</i>

356
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,376
<i>was his daughter Shannon.</i>

<i>Today, Shannon calls herself Pritam...</i>

358

<i>a name given her by the spiritual</i>
<i>leader in India she herself now follows.</i>

359
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,305
<i>But she insists it is not a cult.</i>

360
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,059
[male reporter] <i>Shannon used the money</i>
<i>inherited from her father's life insurance</i>

361

<i>to join Rajneesh.</i>

362
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:47,189
A lot of people would wonder what your
father would feel about you living here.

363
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,400
I feel if my father came to see this
he would see that there's just--

364
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,237
They're exact opposites
as far as I can see.

365
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,322
I mean, I'm sure anybody that was here
could see that.

366
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,534
I mean, if he had been to Jonestown
and survived that and come here,

367
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,118
he'd have seen
they're different as night and day

368
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:01,870
and he would have been totally supportive.

369
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:09,044
Ryan's daughter, she herself explained
it is different here.

370
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:14,967
If they saw it correctly, they would see
that we were no threat to anybody.

371
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:20,806
Oh, we've got the daughter of the guy
that went to do the Jonestown story.

372
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,017
I was like, "What does that
have to do with anything?"

373
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:28,772
But it was an angle.
It was tying Jonestown to us.

374
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:32,568
But it had nothing to do with us.
I mean that story of Jim Jones--

375
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,780
I mean, Jim Jones knew nothing
about Eastern mysticism,

376
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,699
knew nothing about meditation.

377
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:39,950
He was a Christian.

378
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:44,454
He had more to do with them
than he had to do with us.

379
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,457
It's a ridiculous comparison.

380
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:52,129
Our way is of living, not of suicide.

381
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:56,842
We are life affirmative,
not life negative.

382
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:02,264
This whole angle of the cult
was what the Christians could use.

383
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:06,393
I mean, just the word,
because of Jonestown...

384
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,856
it conjured fear.

385
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,358
I think particularly
since the Jones thing,

386
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,819
everyone is a little fearful of cults.

387
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:20,073
And then I have a feeling
that cults control you,

388
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,117
rather than you controlling yourself.

389
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,329
Rajneesh is,
Biblically speaking, an anti-Christ

390
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,331
that the Christian Church
should be aware of

391
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,708
and prepared to answer with the truth.

392
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,920
I just want to be
an example and a testimony

393
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:37,382
to these Rajneesh people and to this world
that's living in darkness.

394
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:41,511
When you approach a person
who is a member of a cult,

395
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:44,556
stand straight
on your own Christian faith,

396
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,934
but in Christian love deal with them.

397
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:53,941
The designation of cult,
the press latched onto this.

398
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,151
Every day they line up at two o'clock

399
00:28:56,235 --> 00:29:00,113
to watch a 52-year-old man
drive by in a Rolls Royce.

400
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,991
Why do they do it?
What do they believe in?

401
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:06,328
[Jayananda] <i>And most of the time,</i>
<i>as you can see in the news,</i>

402

403
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,378
Well, Marcia, we've been looking
at how this self-proclaimed god

404
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,713
arrived from India,
how the cult has grown,

405
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:19,132
how the tension in the area
has escalated as well.

406
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:22,594
And tonight,
are the Rajneeshees dangerous...

407
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,888
not only to their neighbors,
but to all of us?

<i>Today Jim Jones is gone,</i>

409
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:30,978

412
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,278
If Rajneesh wanted to have a Jonestown,

413
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,655
essentially he does have
a Jonestown out in Oregon,

414
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:45,409
and if he commanded his followers
to drink poisoned Kool-Aid,

we've been looking at tonight,

What do you make of them?

<i>of what a cult was, you know?</i>

424
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:15,147
It was like rule-oriented and one leader

425

and supporting the group over the whole,

426

which applied better
to the U.S. Army than us.

427
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:26,742
We were a group of crazy individualists
who just happened to be organized enough

428
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,202
to build this community
because we wanted to do it.

429
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:34,708
We didn't like being told how to believe,
how to pray, how to live.

430

We wanted to be free.

And the anti-cult people, who could--
Who said we were conditioning people,

[clears throat]

439
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,578
It was a shock to the system.

440
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,706
Obviously, it would be, you know?

441
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,794
I think anybody that would see that

442
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,338
would be alarmed
that these are the new neighbors.

443
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:25,634
The encounter was filmed by a young
German director, Wolfgang Dobrowolny.

444
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:29,554
He's a sympathizer with the cult
of the guru Bhagwan Rajneesh.

445
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,598
And it was only because of this

446
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,435
that he was allowed to film and record
aspects of Bhagwan's cult,

447
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,688
to which the BBC and others
would never have been allowed access.

448
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:45,529
This Wolfgang, he takes the hidden camera
in one of the therapy group,

449
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:50,117
which is a violation
of the group individuals.

450
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:56,164
I don't know if it was taken secretly
or whether it was done openly.

00:41:57,807 --> 00:42:03,104
At that point, she really got her back up
and it pissed her off.

599
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,732
[male interviewer]
Thousand Friends of Oregon says

600
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:08,443
that their intention
is to see this place dismantled.

601
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:12,613
Good. They can come. They're most welcome.
I'll be right on the road.

602
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:16,200
They need to drive over me,
it's their choice.

603
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,537
I will paint their bulldozers
with my blood.

604
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,790
And I'll be proud to be
under those bulldozers.

605
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,001
Do you think it'll get to that point?

606
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:30,381
If they are not aware of my determination,
I think they're stupid,

607
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,674
they're unintelligent.

608
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,760
[Sheela]
<i>Thousand Friends of Oregon,</i>

609
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:39,474
they only used land use
to deny us our rights

610
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,018
and derail us,

611
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,937
but we were also a bit smarter.

612
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:49,901
The chief of this outfit,
Sheela Silverman,

613
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,070
is accustomed to getting what she wants

614
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:55,156
and if she can't have her own city
here on the Muddy Ranch,

615
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:59,702
she's determined to buy
the next best thing: the city of Antelope.

616
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:06,626
If you don't find
the little loopholes in the law,

617
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:10,630
it is your loss.

618
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,718
We started buying
the properties in Antelope

619
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:20,098
to secure our existence as a city.

620
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:23,893
And we took over.

621
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:30,066
[Niren] <i>Antelope had</i>
<i>like 40 residents at the time.</i>

622
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,360
Over half of the property in town,

623
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:36,364
by property I mean houses and such,
was for sale, cheap.

624
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,824
<i>So, the easy thing to do</i>

625
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:42,829
<i>was to buy property and then get</i>
<i>all your business operations there.</i>

626
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,163
[Krishna Deva]
<i>We are hung up in court</i>

627
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,874
<i>and we have to come to Antelope</i>
<i>for things like housing,</i>

628
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:50,336
<i>for the store that we have,</i>
<i>for the print shop that we need.</i>

629
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:53,256
And until we have a change of zoning
or our city on the ranch,

630
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:55,007
this'll be the position we're in.

631
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,761
We just got to do
what we got to do to survive.

632
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:02,640
And what do they call it?

633
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:06,394
The takeover of Antelope.

634
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:10,731
In other national news, Antelope, Oregon,

635
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,526
a town out West
where old-timers and newcomers

636
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:16,737
are locked in the kind of feud
that used to be settled with a shoot-out.

637

[female reporter]

639
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:23,578
<i>that isn't deemed respectable</i>
<i>by some local residents.</i>

<i>And the Rajneesh</i>
<i>plan to stay for a long while.</i>

641
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,791
<i>They're buying everything available.</i>

642
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:33,129
What happened here in Antelope is they
basically came in like a steamroller

643
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,255
and just took it.

644
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,675
[male reporter] <i>Until last month,</i>
<i>this was the Antelope Café,</i>

645
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,136
<i>a gathering place</i>
<i>for the town's 40 residents.</i>

646
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:43,097
<i>Then the café was bought</i>
<i>by the commune at Rajneeshpuram.</i>

647
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:47,727
<i>They changed the name to Zorba the Buddha.</i>
<i>Now bananas, not bacon fry on the grill.</i>

648
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:51,981
That was the first one that cracked.
The first one they got to.

649
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,691
[male reporter]
<i>To many residents,</i>

650
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,277
<i>the café exemplifies</i>
<i>what's happening to their town.</i>

651
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,112
I went into that café two weeks ago

652
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,031
and that was the last time
I'll ever go in it.

653
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:02,909
- [female interviewer] Why?
- I just don't like them.

654
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:08,372
It's a combination of two, religious
prejudice as well as Mayflower mentality.

655
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:11,542
I came here before you,
therefore you can't be here.

656
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:16,213
We bought the few housings
that were on sale,

657
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:22,178
<i>and we paid full prices</i>
<i>to Antelope people for purchases.</i>

658
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:25,431
[male reporter] <i>Next to go was</i>
<i>the Hicks property right next door.</i>

659
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:29,185
<i>By the end of March, eight plots of land</i>
<i>plus the café belonged to the commune.</i>

660
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:32,188
[man] <i>Well, they have bought</i>
<i>the old green house</i>

661
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:36,901
<i>and property on the lower end of town</i>
<i>which consists of three or five lots,</i>

662
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:41,197
<i>something like that, and I think</i>
<i>seven lots on the other side of town.</i>

663
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:45,993
I remember this guy up here sitting
with his shotgun on his porch, you know,

664
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,411
"I'll never sell to them."

665
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:50,581
Two weeks later, you know,
he's got the check in his pocket.

666
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,086
And you're talking about older people,
you know, on a fixed budget,

667
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:58,965
and Sheela comes in
with her gold pens and diamond rings,

668
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:03,386
<i>and says "I'll write you a check</i>
<i>for 50,000 dollars for this place."</i>

669
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,597
And people go, "Well, you know,
how can I say no to that?"

670
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:09,141
and take the 50,000 dollars and run.

671
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:16,607
<i>Sheela had said, "If they don't sell now,</i>
<i>they'll sell later... at my figure."</i>

672
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,735
[Sheela]
<i>Homeowners were very happy to sell.</i>

673
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:22,655
<i>They had</i>
<i>their properties for sale for years.</i>

674
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,825
Nobody was buying it. It was a ghost town.

675
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:30,871
And here finally they have
a lucky day where they could sell.

676
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:35,584
All the politicians are talking about
this terrible takeover by this cult...

677
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:40,589
in this small town of older people.

678
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:46,971
We bought property that was for sale.

679
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,974
They get control of the city,
and what chance have we got?

680
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:53,060
We're outnumbered already.

681
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:57,857
And it would be very easy for them
to have control of our town.

682
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:01,193
I don't understand where they get off
saying that, "our town."

683
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:05,114
It is everyone's town.

684
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:08,451
We have the same equal right as they have.

685
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,578
We, as a rural community

686
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:14,790
do not like to be taken over by a cult,

687
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:16,584
which is what's happening.

688
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:20,171
"We're being taken over.
Our community is being destroyed."

689
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,630
It was a ghost town.

690
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:24,592
What was happening was life
was being brought into that community.

691
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:27,053
And it's like we're bad people to do that.

692
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,768
[Bowerman] <i>Well, when the Rajneesh</i>
<i>tried to take over Antelope,</i>

693
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:37,772
<i>it was a battle of sorts,</i>
<i>no different than a war.</i>

694
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:42,485
They immediately started pushing,
they immediately started claiming

695
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,529
that we had offended them in whatever way.

696
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:48,866
And to be right honest,
after the first year,

697
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,244
at least the people around here
didn't want them.

698
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,415
[woman] You're a longtime citizen of
Antelope. Give me your impressions.

699
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:59,752
I don't like anybody who comes in
and tries to take over a town.

700
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,337
And that don't set with me.

701
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,715
I believe there's one God,
and there's only one God.

702
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:10,262
And you start bowing down to a man,
why, you're just letting Satan push you.

703
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:12,556
They're run by Satanic power.

704
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,101

707
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:25,277
And him too.

708
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:30,699
[Niren] <i>The local ranchers,</i>
<i>they were getting really scared.</i>

709
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:36,831
And they start to do things they might not
otherwise not do out of that fear.

710
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:41,168
Scared. And then angry.

711
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:46,340
In addition to fear, there is anger
in Antelope and surrounding communities.

712
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:50,261
Talk of vigilantes who may try
to seek revenge on the Rajneeshees.

Why, sure, they're bullets, .300 Savage.

715
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,769
Now that just signifies
we're going down fighting.

I can't stand
this guy doing this stuff to us.

719

They're invading. Maybe not with bullets,
but with money and with immoral sex.

720
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:19,498
They wanted literally
for us to pack our bags and leave.

[male reporter] <i>Not all challenges</i>

was a "Bag the Bhagwan" sticker.

727

00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,545
They were positively begging for it.

744
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:52,675
You know, there's an old saying
that you pick your enemies carefully,

745
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:56,804
because the way that those enemies fight
are who you become.

746
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:04,979
Almost immediately they started
harassing people in Antelope.

747
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:10,484
They would shine spotlights
in our house at night.

<i>My oldest daughter was screaming.</i>

The light was shining right and just going
back and forth across the window.

750
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:27,418
They were a very vindictive
group of people.

751
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:32,339
<i>These elderly people</i>
<i>would come out to mow their lawn,</i>

752

761
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,782
These people were terrified and they--

762
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:02,202
People going around taking pictures
of them all day long,

763
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:03,829
just nothing but harassment.

764
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:07,207
Now, if that's neighborly love,
I'm in the wrong outfit.

765
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:13,505
After months and months of harassment,
it was just more than we could take.

We couldn't take anymore.
It's a living nightmare.

Everybody was overwhelmed.
You always wondered...

how long it was going to last.

769
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:24,975
If they were going to last longer
than you could last.

that evil does not win the battle.

Antelope, Oregon. It's about to be taken
over by an Indian guru and his followers,

772
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:39,490
and the townspeople
who don't like this idea at all

773
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,701

They say this latest action
will not force them to leave.

891
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:56,403
Nothing is going to scare us
out of Oregon. We're here to stay.

892
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,655
We love it here. It's that simple.

We're preparing for anything,
whether it come by air, by land.

894
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,744
However it comes,
we're going to be prepared for it.

895
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,622
And we want everyone to know that.

896
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:11,209
We want everyone to know
that if you're going to use violence,

897
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:16,214
that we will be ready to take whatever
action is needed to protect ourselves.

After the bombing, it was clear.

899
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:28,185
If I didn't take measures
to protect our community...

900
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:32,272
no one else would do it.

That's when we went out

But if you didn't feel
that way about your children,

904
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,958
it would be pathetic.

Bhagwan had said from the beginning...

906
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:03,428
that, "I'm not Jesus, I'm not Gandhi."

907
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:08,975
When Jesus says,
"You turn your other cheek,"

908
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:12,103
you take both of their cheeks.
