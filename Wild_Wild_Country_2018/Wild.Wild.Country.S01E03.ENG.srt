00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,102
<i>and avoiding an establishment.</i>

446
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,272
<i>There's a lot of establishment cases.</i>

447
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:37,401
Usually, they're about some town

448
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,779
put a crèche scene
on the courthouse steps.

449
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:46,410
Some teacher allowed students to say
a prayer before the beginning of class.

450
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:51,081
Essentially, always
the order is don't do that.

451
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:56,169
You never had a city destroyed
because of the Establishment Clause.

452
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,797
You correct the problem.

453
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,301
So, it's injunctive.
You say stop doing that.

454
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:09,516
<i>Cities that have</i>
<i>a majority of a particular religion</i>

455
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,851
<i>are very, very common.</i>

456
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,187
<i>If you look at our history...</i>

457
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,569
<i>If you look at Catholics in Boston,</i>

458
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,489
<i>were a huge majority</i>
<i>and totally ran the government.</i>

459
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,909
<i>Utah, Mormonism, that's a whole state.</i>

460
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:31,038
<i>But certainly in the city</i>
<i>of Salt Lake City, even today...</i>

461
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,416
<i>nobody tells those people</i>
<i>that they can't have a city.</i>

462
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,336
<i>Nobody thinks that they can't have a city.</i>

463
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:43,091
Nobody ever even raised the issue,
until us.

464
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:47,846
To have it be something as significant

465
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:51,808
as destroying the community

466
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:54,102
<i>of a religious minority...</i>

467
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,023
<i>so that it cannot exist...</i>

468
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,819
which affects
fundamental rights of assembly...

469
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:07,657
speech, religion, association,

470
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:12,746
powerfully impacting on those rights
in a negative way.

471
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,541
I mean, screw religious freedom, right?
Do we really care?

472
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,668
Let's have a simple test...

473
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,130
where the government
can just do what it wants.

474
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:25,509
And minority religions
we don't really care much about.

475
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:33,392
By now, Rajneeshpuram had been licensed
as a police force.

476
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:36,228
Everybody knew that their loyalty
was not to their badge,

477
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,397
their loyalty was to Bhagwan.

478
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,817
<i>So, they had semi-automatic weapons,</i>
<i>tear gas grenades.</i>

479
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:46,029
<i>You had the mayor of Rajneeshpuram</i>
<i>threatening civil war.</i>

480
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,407
What I see here today as I look out

481
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,159
is the beginning of a civil war
in this county.

482
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,744
If that's what you want, fine.

483
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,039
So, yeah, it was a huge problem.

484
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:00,836
<i>We were not out to get the leadership</i>
<i>just to get the leadership.</i>

485
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:05,715
We were looking for the architects
responsible for this very broad scheme

486
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,968
of deceit
against the United States government.

487
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,095
That's the only way
that was going to stop.

488
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,810
It was very clear that all agencies,

489
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,312
<i>Thousand Friends of Oregon,</i>

490

<i>and rest of the politicians</i>

493
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:33,076
were making difficult for our existence.

494
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,787
[female reporter] <i>The governor</i>
<i>has made no secret of his feelings</i>

497
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,505
[male reporter]
<i>Oregon legislature introduced three bills</i>

498
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:49,926
<i>that would repeal the city charters in</i>
<i>both Rajneeshpuram and Rajneesh-Antelope.</i>

499
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:53,722
Legislation was a tool
to destroy the community.

500
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:57,642
My personal favorite
is the initiative petition,

501
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,062
<i>"Expel the Rajneesh cult from Oregon."</i>

502
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,107
I really wonder what they had in mind.

503
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:10,197
I'm both shocked and amused
by the stupidity of Oregon politicians.

504
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:16,036
Oregon is developing an international
reputation as a backwater of bigotry.

505
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:21,166
There was a task force
that had been organized,

506
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,878
addressing the Rajneesh problem...

507
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,965
and how to deal with it.

508
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,635
[male reporter]
<i>On the afternoon of September 26,</i>

509
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,721
<i>a whole variety of state</i>
<i>and federal officials converged</i>

510
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,223
<i>in a conference room in Salem.</i>

511
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:38,433
<i>They were there to discuss</i>
<i>the Rajneeshees,</i>

512
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,268
<i>but the press was not welcome.</i>

513
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,103
<i>The meeting took place</i>
<i>behind closed doors.</i>

514
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:45,607
Well, when's the last time
you heard about a problem,

515
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,068
a Jewish problem, a Rajneesh problem?

516
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,196
What kind of nonsense is this?

517
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,490
What's going on in this state
is what I'd like to know.

518
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,201
It used to be the legislature
was called a circus.

519
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,289
Now I call it a zoo because at least
in a circus the animals are trained.

520
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,792
We had every branch,

521
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:07,087
federal, state, county, local,

522
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,632
organized and united.

523
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:15,428
Your attorney general,
your county commissioners,

524
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:20,725
have made many policies
behind closed doors against Rajneeshees.

525
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:25,438
Go to them now.
Don't come to me about reconciliation.

526
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:30,277
[Niren] <i>For somebody like Sheela,</i>
<i>she was driven</i>

527
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:35,407
out of a real sense that the community
was going to be destroyed.

528
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,909
Those were accurate perceptions.

529
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,786
Persecution must stop.

530
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,332
Persecution of all people, all race,

531
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,168
all religion must stop.

532
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:51,131
Unless this state is ready to do that,

533
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,217
Rajneeshees are not going to stop.

534
00:34:56,344 --> 00:35:01,641
Sheela, over a period of time,
she became the focus.

535
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:05,562
And it was almost by-- By accident.

536
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:10,358
Bhagwan stepped back into his house,
so we didn't see him.

537
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,694
And Sheela stepped forward.

538
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:16,239
And so with time, I just became
more and more devoted to her.

539
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:22,495
I was-- My devotion to Bhagwan
kind of swapped over,

540
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:25,248
and it included not just Bhagwan,
but also Sheela.

541
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:28,543
[laughs]

542
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,421
You never know, Sheela is never, um...

543
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:35,800
She's very spontaneous.
She's extremely spontaneous.

544
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,345
And she moves with the moods.

545
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:42,057
She moves with the wind.
She moves with the time of the day.

546
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,435
I mean, it's funny, you--

547
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:49,481
All of you see me in one position
or another as a spokesperson,

548
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,149
but you don't know me personally.

549
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,985
Because personally,
people can't figure me out.

550
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,948
I'm not the same person you think I am.

551
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,037
Jesus Grove was Sheela's house.

552
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:08,166
<i>As time went on,</i>
<i>it was added to and added to.</i>

553
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:13,296
<i>It became a very big living complex.</i>

554
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,217
<i>And Sheela moved into her house</i>

555
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,304
<i>people who were of use to her.</i>

556
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:26,893
But if you lived in Jesus Grove,
you were at Sheela's beck and call.

557
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:31,898
Jesus Grove was
kind of where the important people

558
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:35,652
that were making important decisions
were hanging out.

559
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,154
Call them Sheela's lieutenants.

560
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:44,327
She had this insular group
that hung on every word

561
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:48,206
because she would go up
and meet with Bhagwan every night.

562
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,792
[male reporter] <i>There's</i>
<i>one appointment Sheela never breaks,</i>

563
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,585
<i>her nightly meeting with Rajneesh.</i>

564
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:55,588
<i>No one is permitted to accompany her</i>
<i>when she meets with Bhagwan.</i>

565
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,507
<i>They reportedly discuss religious matters</i>

566
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,843
<i>and other affairs</i>
<i>that concern Rajneeshpuram.</i>

567
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:05,306
And it became
a kind of a ritual in the evening

568
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,435
<i>when Sheela came back</i>
<i>from being with Bhagwan,</i>

569
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:12,188
and she would tell us stories,
if you like.

570
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,194
<i>She would tell us</i>
<i>about what Bhagwan was saying,</i>

571
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:21,656
<i>what he wanted of us,</i>
<i>what we were going to do next,</i>

572
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,575
why we were going to do it.

573
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:27,370
<i>And I was swept away.</i>

574
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,541
It was beyond my wildest dreams
to ever imagine

575
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:36,045
that I would fill one of these positions
to be so close to Bhagwan.

576
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:42,260
<i>At some point, I was woken in the night.</i>
<i>Eleven o'clock, I was fast asleep in bed</i>

577
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:47,599
<i>and told to come down to Jesus Grove</i>
<i>right away and to bring my wax.</i>

578
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,811
<i>And Sheela wanted me to wax her legs,</i>
<i>so I did.</i>

579
00:37:56,232 --> 00:38:00,278
And not long after that,
Sheela moved me into her house.

580
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:08,453
[Sheela]
<i>We confronted situations always as a unit.</i>

581
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,289
<i>How can we solve the problem?</i>

582
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,502
<i>The more creative we were,</i>

583
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:20,465
the more destructive the politicians
were against us.

584
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:27,222
<i>It was their hate</i>
<i>that forced us to take these steps</i>

585
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:31,518
for self-preservation,
self-protection, self-survival.

586
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:35,396
[female reporter] I understand
that you have an announcement

587
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,481
that is in the offing.

588
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,442
- That's correct.
- That everyone is waiting patiently for.

589
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:45,114
Um... Can you maybe give us some idea
of when we should expect to hear that?

590
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:47,575
Everybody is waiting patiently.
I would say the same thing.

591
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,285
You need to wait patiently too.

592
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,374
Any indication of the magnitude
of that announcement?

593
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,458
It's going to be...

594
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,922
probably the first project

There's a beautiful city in Oregon

00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,862
- Ain't no drugs there, right?
- No drugs.

609
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:09,824
- You can't drink?
- Well, you get two beers a day.

- Yeah.

"What's going on?"

The unknown is what we fear.

what they'll do next.

711
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,255
It was kind of a mystery,
but people just thought they were crazy.

<i>These homeless people</i>
<i>were just kind of showing up.</i>

<i>in vacant lots or people's garages</i>

what they were really doing.

717

The offer is one a lot of Wasco County
residents think is too good to be true.

718
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,034
They're asking themselves why their
Rajneeshee neighbors to the south

719
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:10,161
are suddenly so generous and open
with their city.

720

Six thousand of them
from all over the country.

we're going to give you a roof
over your head,

723
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:23,174
and all you have to do is vote.

724
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:32,308
The elections of '84

725
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,351
to shut down Rajneeshpuram.

726
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:38,105

<i>Republican anti-Rajneeshee commission.</i>

728

So, Bhagwan told Sheela
it was time to take over Wasco County.

729
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,953
We were to have three Rajneesh
representatives on Wasco County,

730
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,040
and he was pushing her really hard.

731
00:47:56,123 --> 00:48:00,169
At that point,
if we didn't protect ourselves

732
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:06,425
with what law allows
to bring these homeless people,

733
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:11,013
uh... it would be stupid on our part.

[Burford]
So you want to control Wasco County?

742
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,624
Absolutely, now I do.

743
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,876
And I will be the first person
to campaign.

744
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,170
It needs to be at a boiling point,

745
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:47,133
so once and for all it can evaporate.

746
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:52,721
[Burford] But a boiling point
implies someone is going to get burned.

747
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,515
So what?

748
00:48:54,598 --> 00:49:00,271
For humanity, a little burn here or there,
it's worth it.

749
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,691
The shipments of homeless continue
to arrive here every day.

750
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:08,279
<i>So, just how many Rajneesh votes will be</i>

751
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:09,864
All veterans!

752
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,909
All veterans to the desk, please!

<i>Rajneeshees and street people alike.</i>

We have come home,
and we have done the right thing.

757
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,509
The master has brought us home
to protect us

758
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:35,472
from the neo-colonial,
imperialistic, technocratic society

759
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:37,433
of the United States of aggression.

760
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:42,146
There's a lot of people out there
that are supposedly Christians.

761
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,610
That have not given us
this opportunity that you've given us.

762
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:50,362
They told me they wouldn't have me.

763
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:53,949
- We got a home. Let's keep it.
- [cheering]

764
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:57,661
And the ones that don't want it,
get the hell out!

765
00:49:57,745 --> 00:50:00,456
[cheering and applause]

766
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:07,338
The fact that they had brought
all these people in,

767
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,299
6,000 of them from all over the country,

768
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:13,677
suddenly opened eyes
to the fact that, okay,

769
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:16,388
they took over Antelope,
that's Antelope's problem.

770
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:19,225
They're going to take over Wasco County.

771
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:22,686
That might be a little bigger deal
than just Wasco County's problem

772
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,483
because they get the county,
are they going to get the state next?

773
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:31,779
Good evening. People in Wasco County met
tonight trying to fight the Rajneeshees.

774
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:35,282
It was the biggest ever
anti-Rajneesh rally, about 2,000 people.

775
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,868
[male reporter]
<i>They are angry, frustrated, and fearful.</i>

776
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:41,580

<i>There were so many people here tonight</i>

779
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,962
<i>they spilled out into the hallways</i>
<i>of The Dalles High School.</i>

780

782
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:58,764
They brought these people to take over

783
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,809
the central part of the state of Oregon.

784
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:09,149
Now, I want to tell you folks that there
is no way that we can stop them,

785
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:15,239
when you have counties that only
have 570 and 800 voters.

786
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,491
[cheering and applause]

787
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,702
I think it was a done deal.

788
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:23,580
If all 6,000 of them had voted as a block,
they couldn't beat them.

789
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:27,126
When they've made statements
that within the next 15 years,

790
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,336
before the year 2000,
they'll control of the state.

791
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,754
I think that's a very great threat.

792
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:34,550
And the way our voting laws are, I'm--
[chuckles] I'm scared about it really.

793
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:38,012
[man] <i>If they can field</i>
<i>six or 7,000 votes,</i>

794

with some write-in candidate.

795
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:44,018
They're a group of people
that don't like to be defeated.

796
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:48,981
[female reporter] <i>Is it possible for</i>
<i>the Rajneeshees to take over Wasco County?</i>

797
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:52,985
They could very easily
take over Wasco County, yes.

798
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:59,283
We became concerned working
with the secretary of state

799
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:03,245
that we needed to take steps
to make sure that only people

800
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:06,373
who were legitimate voters in Oregon,

801
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:11,754
people who were in Oregon and intended
to be residents of Oregon would vote.

802
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:15,132
How is it legal for people
to step off a bus and literally vote?

803
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:19,136
As long as you're a U.S. citizen,
18 years of age on election day,

804
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:23,057
and a resident of the state of Oregon
for 20 days, you can register to vote.

805
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,936
There were very few tools available
to us or the secretary of state

806
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:33,317
because Oregon then and now
was in the forefront of easy voting.

807
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,111
Let's assume
that your worst fears are correct,

808
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:38,697
that all these people
are now going to go and vote.

809
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:42,242
As I said before, you helped pass the kind
of legislation that makes it possible.

810
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:44,203
Maybe they don't like you,
they vote you out of office,

811
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,412
that's the American way, isn't it?

812
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:48,832
It's ironic that in looking
through the statutes now

813
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,751
and watching buses roll by,

814
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:54,254
Oregon law, at this point,
will not prohibit that.

815
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:58,592
American way is that Constitution
should be upheld

816
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,595
and anybody who wants to vote
should be allowed to vote.

That's what I said, there is no crime.

825

826

I mean, it's simply no crime.

827
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,799
Sure. They moved in,
they were brought there,

828
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:41,510
they were sympathetic
to the community, of course,

829
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,303
so they wanted to vote.

830
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:47,015
As soon as these people came,
maybe they haven't voted in years,

831
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:50,644
but when they heard their right to vote
was being threatened, they all said,

832
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,104
"Hell with it, I'm gonna vote."

here and they try to say I can't vote.

They sedated him,

out on a park bench.
