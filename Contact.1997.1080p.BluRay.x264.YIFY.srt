1
00:00:56,745 --> 00:01:00,748
It's obviously a
major malfunction.

2
00:01:15,762 --> 00:01:18,557
...their President is a
crook. Well, I'm not a crook.

3
00:01:22,476 --> 00:01:26,273
Robert Kennedy was
shot in that ballroom.

4
00:01:28,815 --> 00:01:31,234
Thank God Almighty,
we are free at last!

5
00:01:31,527 --> 00:01:34,363
A sniper has fired
at President Kennedy.

6
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:46,206
Or have you ever been a
member of the Communist party?

7
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,629
Hi-yo, Silver!

8
00:01:57,508 --> 00:01:59,259
...1941...

9
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:03,181
...a date which
will live in infamy.

10
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:09,511
We bring you the
final edition of

11
00:02:09,512 --> 00:02:11,772
our Maxwell House
Good News of 1939.

12
00:02:12,105 --> 00:02:13,846
Good evening,
Mr. and Mrs. North

13
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:15,691
America, and all
the ships at sea.

14
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:25,158
The only thing we have
to fear is fear itself.

15
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,681
CQ...

16
00:03:34,054 --> 00:03:36,056
...this is W-9 GFO.

17
00:03:38,308 --> 00:03:41,687
CQ, this is W-9
GFO here. Come back?

18
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:46,816
CQ...

19
00:03:47,024 --> 00:03:49,652
...this is W-9 GFO here.

20
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:51,738
Come back?

21
00:03:55,658 --> 00:03:59,828
CQ, this is W-9 GFO.
Is anybody out there?

22
00:04:00,872 --> 00:04:01,997
Not getting anything.

23
00:04:02,288 --> 00:04:03,789
Small moves, Ellie.

24
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:06,585
Small moves.

25
00:04:09,213 --> 00:04:12,964
CQ, this is W-9
GFO here. Come back?

26
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:15,551
Copy, W-9 GFO.

27
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,637
K-4 WLD here.

28
00:04:18,052 --> 00:04:19,471
What do I say?

29
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:21,138
Just be yourself.

30
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,308
Where are you,
K-4 WLD? Come back?

31
00:04:24,518 --> 00:04:25,810
Pensacola. Over.

32
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:27,645
Pensacola, where's Pensacola?

33
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:29,437
I'll give you a hint.

34
00:04:30,148 --> 00:04:31,274
Orange juice.

35
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,737
Copy that, K-4 WLD. How's the
weather down there in Florida?

36
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,949
Pensacola, Florida.

37
00:04:41,617 --> 00:04:43,452
I have to tell you, Sparks.

38
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:46,622
1,116 miles.

39
00:04:48,165 --> 00:04:49,290
Pretty good.

40
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,125
That's the farthest yet.

41
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,846
Can we hear all
the way to New York?

42
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,307
Sure.

43
00:05:08,682 --> 00:05:10,683
Can we hear all the
way to California?

44
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:12,646
I don't see why not.

45
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:15,396
Can we hear all
the way to Alaska?

46
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,107
On a really clear day.

47
00:05:17,315 --> 00:05:19,317
Can we hear all
the way to China?

48
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,820
On a really, really clear day.

49
00:05:24,656 --> 00:05:26,865
Could we talk to the moon?

50
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,327
If it's a big enough
radio, I don't see why not.

51
00:05:30,993 --> 00:05:32,995
Could we talk to Jupiter?

52
00:05:33,204 --> 00:05:35,706
Or what's the one after that?

53
00:05:36,164 --> 00:05:37,459
Don't tell me.

54
00:05:39,877 --> 00:05:41,212
I'll give you a hint.

55
00:05:41,671 --> 00:05:42,839
Hula-Hoops.

56
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:45,049
Saturn! Could we
talk to Saturn?

57
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,225
Dad, could we talk to Mom?

58
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:02,107
I don't think even the biggest
radio could reach that far.

59
00:06:07,112 --> 00:06:08,945
All right, no more stalling.

60
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:15,368
Pensacola!

61
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:24,461
That's a beauty.

62
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,380
Now get some sleep.

63
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:37,013
Hey, Dad?

64
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,724
Do you think there's
people on other planets?

65
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:42,602
I don't know, Sparks.

66
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,731
But I guess I'd say...

67
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,106
...if it is just us...

68
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:51,944
...it seems like an
awful waste of space.

69
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:13,963
CQ, this is W-9 GFO.

70
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:16,760
Repeat. This is
W-9 GFO. Come back?

71
00:07:24,807 --> 00:07:26,810
I'm going to need
a bigger antenna.

72
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,459
What do you think, Doc Arroway?

73
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:57,168
Isn't she a beauty?

74
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:02,425
It'll do.

75
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:04,593
The village is five miles away.

76
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:07,084
There's a general
store in the cantina.

77
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:09,306
They can order
anything from San Juan.

78
00:08:09,513 --> 00:08:11,015
When can I get dish time?

79
00:08:11,182 --> 00:08:12,736
Dr. Clark said you couldn't

80
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:14,809
wait. Your first
shift is tonight.

81
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:12,070
Go back.

82
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:16,743
Try back a little bit.
You had something there.

83
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:19,079
There!

84
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,244
- Right there?

85
00:09:20,244 --> 00:09:22,623
- You hear it? Right
there, that's it.

86
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:26,585
All right, 1221.46. That's
well within the L-band.

87
00:09:26,918 --> 00:09:27,876
Check off-axis.

88
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,045
On it.

89
00:09:31,756 --> 00:09:33,256
It's not in the neighborhood.

90
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:44,101
Here it is. J-1741...

91
00:09:44,393 --> 00:09:46,060
...+ 2748.

92
00:09:46,268 --> 00:09:49,438
Catalogued November
4, 1982. Pulsar.

93
00:09:52,107 --> 00:09:55,235
Must've been the glitch in
the timing's what threw me.

94
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:57,113
Must've been a starquake.

95
00:09:58,489 --> 00:10:00,143
I think it's great that you

96
00:10:00,144 --> 00:10:02,409
listen. Most don't
do that anymore.

97
00:10:02,617 --> 00:10:05,413
It's just an old habit.
It makes it feel more real.

98
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,538
Ellie.

99
00:10:06,746 --> 00:10:07,914
Kent Clark.

100
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,420
They said you'd been...

101
00:10:12,627 --> 00:10:15,087
...up at Owen's Valley
working under Drumlin.

102
00:10:15,255 --> 00:10:16,631
How'd you like him?

103
00:10:19,842 --> 00:10:21,817
That much? About
what I'd expect

104
00:10:21,818 --> 00:10:23,971
after what he had
to say about you.

105
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:25,931
And what was that?

106
00:10:26,472 --> 00:10:27,973
That you are brilliant...

107
00:10:28,265 --> 00:10:29,475
...driven...

108
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,311
...a major pain in the ass...

109
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:33,017
...and obsessed with a field of

110
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:34,522
study he considers
tantamount...

111
00:10:34,687 --> 00:10:36,106
...to professional suicide.

112
00:10:36,815 --> 00:10:37,816
Anything else?

113
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:39,776
Those were the highlights.

114
00:10:40,318 --> 00:10:42,779
Davio, Dr. Vernon. Dr. Arroway.

115
00:10:44,321 --> 00:10:46,577
Believe you've already
met our tireless

116
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:48,492
research assistant,
Mr. Fisher...

117
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,494
...as well as his cologne.

118
00:10:52,162 --> 00:10:54,497
Brook's looking at
the black hole in M-87.

119
00:10:54,665 --> 00:10:58,502
Eli's studying Markarian
541, a major gamma ray source.

120
00:10:58,835 --> 00:11:00,899
Dr. Arroway will
be spending her

121
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,465
precious telescope
time listening for...

122
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:06,176
...listening for...

123
00:11:06,383 --> 00:11:07,886
Little green men.

124
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:17,268
One down...

125
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:19,520
...a couple billion to go.

126
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,164
Arecibo, right?

127
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,499
Does it show?

128
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,793
Cracker Jack?

129
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:44,795
No, thanks.

130
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:46,296
Mind if I sit down?

131
00:11:48,214 --> 00:11:52,133
I hear the locals, they
call it "El Radar. "

132
00:11:52,343 --> 00:11:54,969
Convinced it has some
dark military purpose.

133
00:11:55,388 --> 00:11:56,805
I think we're harmless.

134
00:11:58,263 --> 00:11:59,432
Palmer Joss.

135
00:12:00,224 --> 00:12:02,727
- Ellie Arroway.
- Nice to meet you, Ellie.

136
00:12:03,894 --> 00:12:06,687
What are you studying up there?

137
00:12:08,564 --> 00:12:09,859
The usual.

138
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:13,861
Nebulae, quasars,
pulsars, stuff like that.

139
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:15,738
What are you writing?

140
00:12:16,071 --> 00:12:18,241
The usual. Nouns, adverbs...

141
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,992
...adjective here and there.

142
00:12:21,744 --> 00:12:23,286
I work on a project, SETI.

143
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,083
Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence?

144
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,918
That is out there!

145
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:33,463
Are you a student or something?

146
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,091
I'm a writer. I'm
writing a book.

147
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:38,713
I'm here doing
research about how

148
00:12:38,714 --> 00:12:41,220
technology affects
Third World cultures.

149
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,099
I'm also looking for
this guy, David Drumlin.

150
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:46,506
He's head of the
National Science

151
00:12:46,507 --> 00:12:48,519
Foundation. I
want an interview.

152
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,522
I take it you know him?

153
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,440
You could say that.

154
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,277
SETI.

155
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,155
That's fringe!

156
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:01,869
I've crossed paths
with him. Something

157
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,991
like that must
really chap his ass.

158
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:07,995
Compass.

159
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,290
That's for you.

160
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,629
You better keep this.

161
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:20,505
Might save your life someday.

162
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:26,887
Have dinner with me tonight?

163
00:13:29,848 --> 00:13:33,142
I don't make a good research
subject. I'm not quotable.

164
00:13:33,477 --> 00:13:35,771
No quotes. Scout's honor.

165
00:13:36,187 --> 00:13:37,480
Good meal, good company.

166
00:13:38,354 --> 00:13:39,648
I've got to go.

167
00:13:48,822 --> 00:13:50,617
Drumlin's coming in Tuesday.

168
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,879
Now I remember why
I took that desk job.

169
00:14:04,421 --> 00:14:06,424
Dr. Drumlin, how are you?

170
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:09,551
Glad you could make it.

171
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:13,680
If I'd known it took 3 planes,
I might've reconsidered.

172
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:15,223
How is that new office?

173
00:14:15,432 --> 00:14:17,677
Still settling in.
They already want

174
00:14:17,678 --> 00:14:20,102
to give half my
budget to the Pentagon.

175
00:14:20,853 --> 00:14:23,230
Still waiting for E.T. to call?

176
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:26,858
Good to see you too!

177
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,401
Asshole!

178
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,861
Looks like it's going
to be a long night.

179
00:14:31,072 --> 00:14:33,343
Science must be
accountable to the

180
00:14:33,344 --> 00:14:35,741
people paying for
it, the taxpayers.

181
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:39,202
We must stop wasting money on
pie-in-the-sky abstractions...

182
00:14:39,371 --> 00:14:42,205
...and spend it on
practical, measurable ways...

183
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:45,083
...to improve the lives of
the people who are paying.

184
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,461
Not unlike my L-band,
globular clusters work.

185
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:51,673
You want to do away with
all pure research now?

186
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,260
What's wrong with science being
practical? Even profitable?

187
00:14:55,467 --> 00:14:57,594
Nothing, as long
as your motive...

188
00:14:57,886 --> 00:14:59,796
...is the search
for truth. Which

189
00:14:59,797 --> 00:15:01,764
is what the pursuit
of science is.

190
00:15:04,393 --> 00:15:06,770
That's an interesting
position from a man...

191
00:15:06,978 --> 00:15:09,604
...on a crusade against
the evils of technology...

192
00:15:09,897 --> 00:15:11,024
...Father Joss.

193
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,028
I'm not against technology,
Doctor. I'm against...

194
00:15:15,236 --> 00:15:18,487
...the men who deify it at
the expense of human truth.

195
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:25,953
Kent, I need to have a word
with you. Over here, please.

196
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:34,755
You think that hurt my
chances with that interview?

197
00:15:35,378 --> 00:15:36,797
You're a priest?

198
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:39,884
Not really.

199
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:43,387
I got my Masters in Divinity...

200
00:15:43,887 --> 00:15:47,307
...then left the seminary to
do secular humanitarian work...

201
00:15:47,557 --> 00:15:49,976
...coordinating
Third World churches.

202
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:52,770
I couldn't live with
the celibacy thing.

203
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,442
You could call me
a man of the cloth...

204
00:16:00,735 --> 00:16:02,279
...without the cloth.

205
00:16:05,656 --> 00:16:07,241
You want to get out of here?

206
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:11,163
You see that large W-shaped

207
00:16:11,164 --> 00:16:14,081
constellation there?
That's Cassiopeia.

208
00:16:14,498 --> 00:16:18,919
And Cassiopeia A gives off
a whole lot of radio signals.

209
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:20,920
I listen to them a lot.

210
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:23,465
It's a remnant of a supernova.

211
00:16:24,465 --> 00:16:27,092
When did you know you
wanted to be an astronomer?

212
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,722
When I was about
eight years old...

213
00:16:31,931 --> 00:16:34,358
...watching the
sunset, I asked Dad,

214
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,851
"What's that bright
star over there?"

215
00:16:40,313 --> 00:16:43,440
He said that it wasn't
a star. It was...

216
00:16:45,361 --> 00:16:47,779
...a whole planet
called Venus...

217
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:54,618
...which should
be over there soon.

218
00:16:55,619 --> 00:16:57,995
He said, "You know why
they called it Venus?

219
00:16:58,455 --> 00:17:01,667
Because they thought it was
so beautiful and glowing.

220
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,501
But they didn't know...

221
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,838
...that it's filled with...

222
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:11,466
...deadly gases and
sulfuric acid rain. "

223
00:17:12,802 --> 00:17:16,304
Wow, I thought, "This
is it! I'm hooked!"

224
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:22,185
There are four hundred
billion stars out there...

225
00:17:22,477 --> 00:17:24,311
...just in our galaxy alone.

226
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:28,982
If only one out of a million
of those had planets...

227
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,527
...if just one out of a
million of those had life...

228
00:17:32,694 --> 00:17:34,871
...and if just one
out of a million

229
00:17:34,872 --> 00:17:36,865
of those had
intelligent life...

230
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:40,167
...there would be
literally millions

231
00:17:40,168 --> 00:17:42,202
of civilizations out there...

232
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:45,664
If there wasn't...

233
00:17:46,582 --> 00:17:48,751
...it'd be an awful
waste of space.

234
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:55,882
Amen.

235
00:18:04,806 --> 00:18:08,769
So I was lying there,
just looking at the sky.

236
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,692
And then I felt
something. I don't know.

237
00:18:17,027 --> 00:18:19,696
All I know is that
I wasn't alone.

238
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:24,282
For the first time in my life
I wasn't scared of nothing...

239
00:18:25,243 --> 00:18:26,827
...not even dying.

240
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,250
It was God.

241
00:18:37,003 --> 00:18:38,962
And there's no chance that...

242
00:18:39,464 --> 00:18:41,583
...you had this
experience because

243
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:43,759
some part of you
needed to have it?

244
00:18:44,968 --> 00:18:48,429
I'm a reasonably
intelligent guy, but this...

245
00:18:51,308 --> 00:18:54,976
My intellect couldn't
even touch this.

246
00:18:55,521 --> 00:18:56,479
No.

247
00:18:58,982 --> 00:19:01,609
I've been to Sunday
school a few times.

248
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,695
And?

249
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:09,448
I kept asking all these really
annoying questions like...

250
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:12,785
..."Where did Mrs.
Cain come from?"

251
00:19:14,744 --> 00:19:17,081
And pretty soon
they asked my dad...

252
00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:20,041
...if he wouldn't mind
keeping me home from now on.

253
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:21,584
Your dad...

254
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:24,838
Is it this guy?

255
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:26,213
Yeah.

256
00:19:28,342 --> 00:19:30,344
You're close to
him, aren't you?

257
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:34,806
I was. He died when
I was nine years old.

258
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:38,976
I never got to know my mother.

259
00:19:40,645 --> 00:19:41,938
I'm sorry.

260
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:48,402
That's got to be tough.

261
00:19:52,865 --> 00:19:54,490
Being alone.

262
00:20:03,373 --> 00:20:04,623
What do you say...

263
00:20:04,874 --> 00:20:08,337
...we pack a picnic tomorrow
and hike up to Mount Arecibo?

264
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:12,214
I don't think I can.
I've got to work.

265
00:20:14,008 --> 00:20:17,428
How about dinner tomorrow
night? I know a great dive.

266
00:20:17,845 --> 00:20:19,387
No, I don't think so.

267
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,226
Ellie, did I miss something?

268
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:29,522
No.

269
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,566
Shit, I'm late!

270
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:35,444
I told Kent that I'd
be there at 10:30.

271
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,907
I'm not trying to push you.

272
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,368
I've wanted to look at
this sector for weeks.

273
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,242
Just hang out...

274
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,538
...and sleep in. There's
food in the fridge.

275
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,334
How can I reach you?

276
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,212
Just leave your
number. I'll call you.

277
00:21:16,022 --> 00:21:16,981
Dad!

278
00:21:19,026 --> 00:21:21,570
It's starting, you're
going to miss it!

279
00:21:25,156 --> 00:21:27,366
Dad, there's another
one! Hurry up!

280
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:29,911
In a minute, Sparks!
I'm almost done.

281
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:32,622
There's another one.
Come on, hurry up, Dad!

282
00:22:28,298 --> 00:22:29,467
I'll get the medicine.

283
00:23:49,204 --> 00:23:51,916
I know it's hard to
understand this now...

284
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:55,218
...but we aren't
always meant to know

285
00:23:55,219 --> 00:23:57,379
why things happen
the way they do.

286
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,215
Sometimes, we just
have to accept it...

287
00:24:00,423 --> 00:24:02,259
...as God's will.

288
00:24:04,218 --> 00:24:07,389
I should have kept medicine
in the downstairs bathroom.

289
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:10,266
Then I could've
gotten to it sooner.

290
00:24:36,122 --> 00:24:37,456
CQ...

291
00:24:38,624 --> 00:24:41,627
...this is W-9
GFO. Do you copy?

292
00:24:45,255 --> 00:24:47,548
Dad, this is Ellie. Come back.

293
00:24:50,968 --> 00:24:52,887
This is Eleanor Arroway...

294
00:24:53,137 --> 00:24:56,140
...transmitting
on 14.2 megahertz.

295
00:25:02,855 --> 00:25:04,314
Are you there?

296
00:25:06,525 --> 00:25:07,901
Come back.

297
00:25:14,658 --> 00:25:16,076
Are you there?

298
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,036
Dad, this is Ellie.

299
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:54,526
Hi, Kent. What are
you doing up so early?

300
00:25:55,652 --> 00:25:56,988
I was thinking...

301
00:25:57,862 --> 00:25:59,864
...we'd make a
pretty good team.

302
00:26:00,532 --> 00:26:04,120
We could put together
an ad hoc SETI program.

303
00:26:04,328 --> 00:26:06,621
You know the Very Large
Array in New Mexico?

304
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,164
It's a dynamite place
to do SETI work...

305
00:26:09,373 --> 00:26:11,165
What are you talking about?

306
00:26:13,585 --> 00:26:15,337
Drumlin pulled the plug.

307
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:17,090
We're homeless.

308
00:26:31,394 --> 00:26:33,021
It's true, you pulled the plug?

309
00:26:33,229 --> 00:26:35,772
You can't see it now,
but I'm doing you a favor.

310
00:26:35,981 --> 00:26:38,012
You're too promising
a scientist to

311
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,986
waste your gifts
on this nonsense.

312
00:26:40,235 --> 00:26:42,236
I don't consider
what could be...

313
00:26:42,446 --> 00:26:45,282
...the most important
human discovery nonsense!

314
00:26:45,573 --> 00:26:46,908
400 billion stars...

315
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:50,078
And two probabilities. One,
there's intelligent life...

316
00:26:50,286 --> 00:26:52,704
...but too far away to
contact in your lifetime.

317
00:26:53,413 --> 00:26:55,333
- And two!
- You're making a decision...

318
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:57,914
There's nothing
but gases and carbon

319
00:26:57,915 --> 00:27:00,211
compounds and you're
wasting your time!

320
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,382
In the meantime, you
won't be taken seriously.

321
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,257
Your career will be over!

322
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:06,676
So what?

323
00:27:06,968 --> 00:27:08,385
It's my life!

324
00:27:46,129 --> 00:27:48,632
Hey, Kent. You were right.

325
00:27:49,006 --> 00:27:50,914
Screw Drumlin.
We'll raise the money

326
00:27:50,915 --> 00:27:52,719
ourselves. We'll
go to New Mexico.

327
00:27:52,969 --> 00:27:55,262
Chicago's set. Let
me know how it goes.

328
00:27:55,513 --> 00:27:58,430
I've got more corporate stops
on the East Coast for you.

329
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,769
Did that investor from
Houston ever get back to us?

330
00:28:01,936 --> 00:28:03,937
I'll hit him up
on my way to L.A.

331
00:28:04,145 --> 00:28:06,313
Beg for some of
that Hollywood money!

332
00:28:06,523 --> 00:28:09,609
They've been making money
off aliens for years.

333
00:28:10,235 --> 00:28:12,861
- Begging is good for the soul.
- We'll see.

334
00:28:13,237 --> 00:28:14,863
Just do me a favor.

335
00:28:15,238 --> 00:28:17,699
Try not to be too...
confrontational.

336
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,493
Confrontational?
Me? What do you mean?

337
00:28:20,702 --> 00:28:22,328
I'll see if I left anything.

338
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,540
It's a unique time
in our history,

339
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:59,488
in the history of
any civilization.

340
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:02,448
It's the moment of the
acquisition of technology.

341
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:05,492
That's the moment where
contact becomes possible.

342
00:29:06,284 --> 00:29:08,537
The Very Large Array
in New Mexico...

343
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,040
...is the key to our
chances for success.

344
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,334
With its 27 linked
radio telescopes...

345
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:15,502
...we can search
more accurately

346
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,129
than at any other facility.

347
00:29:17,295 --> 00:29:19,550
We've gotten
approval to buy the

348
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:22,007
telescope time
from the government.

349
00:29:22,883 --> 00:29:25,052
Now all we really
need is the money.

350
00:29:25,803 --> 00:29:27,805
A nice presentation, Doctor.

351
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:31,515
But while our foundation arm
has a mandate to support...

352
00:29:31,725 --> 00:29:34,811
...experimental
programs, your proposal...

353
00:29:35,061 --> 00:29:39,065
...seems less like science,
and more like science fiction.

354
00:29:41,568 --> 00:29:42,985
Science fiction.

355
00:29:46,446 --> 00:29:47,822
You're right.

356
00:29:48,615 --> 00:29:49,992
It's crazy.

357
00:29:51,076 --> 00:29:53,661
In fact, it's even
worse than that: nuts!

358
00:29:55,747 --> 00:29:57,207
Want to hear something nutty?

359
00:29:57,373 --> 00:29:59,917
Two guys wanted to build
a thing called an airplane.

360
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:03,169
People go in it and fly like
birds. Ridiculous, right?

361
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,171
What about breaking
the sound barrier...

362
00:30:05,421 --> 00:30:07,035
...or rockets to the moon, or

363
00:30:07,036 --> 00:30:09,092
atomic energy or
a mission to Mars?

364
00:30:09,343 --> 00:30:10,969
Science fiction, right?

365
00:30:12,762 --> 00:30:14,889
All I'm asking
is for you to just

366
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,890
have the tiniest bit of vision.

367
00:30:17,264 --> 00:30:20,602
To step back and look
at the big picture.

368
00:30:20,979 --> 00:30:23,602
Take a chance on
something which could

369
00:30:23,603 --> 00:30:26,025
end up the most
impactful moment...

370
00:30:26,276 --> 00:30:28,569
...for humanity,
for the history...

371
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,486
...of history.

372
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:35,284
I'm sorry.

373
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,994
I just spent 13 months...

374
00:30:38,618 --> 00:30:41,455
...coming into rooms and
talking to people like you.

375
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,708
You're my last chance.

376
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:46,751
Sorry I wasted your time.

377
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,543
Doctor.

378
00:30:48,421 --> 00:30:49,504
Yes, sir.

379
00:31:01,849 --> 00:31:03,099
You have your money.

380
00:31:06,144 --> 00:31:07,313
Thank you.

381
00:31:09,397 --> 00:31:10,399
Thank you.

382
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,402
Perfect cast! Come on, fishy!

383
00:32:01,652 --> 00:32:03,154
Frank, look at the size...

384
00:32:03,365 --> 00:32:05,366
...of that
son-of-a-bitch!

385
00:32:17,793 --> 00:32:19,752
Welcome back, Dr. C.

386
00:32:20,003 --> 00:32:21,505
How'd it go?

387
00:32:22,172 --> 00:32:23,757
How was the trip?

388
00:32:24,006 --> 00:32:25,424
I've had better.

389
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:29,096
Drumlin! Is this a
personal vendetta now?

390
00:32:29,345 --> 00:32:33,181
There's been enormous pressure
from other scientists as well.

391
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:36,517
It doesn't matter. Hadden's
funding us for 2 more years.

392
00:32:36,728 --> 00:32:38,768
The government
doesn't want their

393
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:41,231
telescopes used by
the high priestess...

394
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:43,441
...of the desert anymore.

395
00:32:44,774 --> 00:32:45,735
What?

396
00:32:45,902 --> 00:32:49,238
Staring at TV static for hours,
listening to washing machines.

397
00:32:49,487 --> 00:32:51,489
These stories get out!

398
00:32:51,698 --> 00:32:53,367
I was seeking
patterns in the chaos!

399
00:32:53,534 --> 00:32:55,620
It doesn't matter,
we're a joke to them.

400
00:32:55,828 --> 00:32:57,204
They want us out!

401
00:32:58,997 --> 00:33:01,875
We've got 3 months till
the paperwork goes through.

402
00:33:05,712 --> 00:33:07,880
I'll start looking
for other funding.

403
00:33:08,422 --> 00:33:12,176
Could you face reality?
Just this once? We lost.

404
00:33:12,926 --> 00:33:14,220
It's over.

405
00:33:20,892 --> 00:33:22,059
Fine.

406
00:33:22,727 --> 00:33:24,311
I'm not stopping.

407
00:33:24,895 --> 00:33:27,983
If I have to, I'll go it
alone. I've done it before.

408
00:34:17,693 --> 00:34:21,406
My guest tonight is author
and theologian Palmer Joss.

409
00:34:21,738 --> 00:34:24,157
He's become a
spiritual counselor, and

410
00:34:24,158 --> 00:34:26,452
a recent fixture
at the White House.

411
00:34:26,744 --> 00:34:29,706
"God's Diplomat," according
to The New York Times.

412
00:34:29,913 --> 00:34:31,932
His latest book,
"Losing Faith,"

413
00:34:31,933 --> 00:34:33,585
is currently number one...

414
00:34:33,793 --> 00:34:36,087
...on that publication's
bestseller list.

415
00:34:36,294 --> 00:34:39,255
Thanks for being here.
You've had quite a ride...

416
00:34:39,463 --> 00:34:40,965
...the last few years.

417
00:34:41,132 --> 00:34:42,842
Yeah, I sure have, Larry.

418
00:34:43,634 --> 00:34:45,844
Fish, I was thinking.

419
00:34:46,262 --> 00:34:50,600
Who would make the best
astronomers? Think about it.

420
00:34:50,932 --> 00:34:55,729
Who has the perfect synthesis
of career and lifestyle?

421
00:34:56,938 --> 00:34:57,898
I give.

422
00:34:58,105 --> 00:34:59,649
Vampires!

423
00:34:59,983 --> 00:35:02,526
Are you anti-technology
and anti-science?

424
00:35:02,777 --> 00:35:04,444
No, not at all.

425
00:35:04,779 --> 00:35:07,572
The question that
I'm asking is this:

426
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:09,783
Are we happier...

427
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,229
...as a human
race? Is the world

428
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,953
fundamentally a better place...

429
00:35:14,161 --> 00:35:16,164
...because of science
and technology?

430
00:35:16,831 --> 00:35:19,292
We shop at home,
we surf the Web...

431
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:22,127
...but at the same
time we feel emptier...

432
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,684
...and more cut
off from each other

433
00:35:24,685 --> 00:35:27,215
than at any other
time in human history.

434
00:35:27,465 --> 00:35:30,009
We're becoming a
synthesized society...

435
00:35:30,301 --> 00:35:32,470
...in a hurry to get to the...

436
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:48,862
We're looking for the meaning.

437
00:35:49,193 --> 00:35:50,486
What is the meaning?

438
00:35:50,654 --> 00:35:53,406
We have mindless jobs,
take frantic vacations.

439
00:35:53,823 --> 00:35:56,783
Deficit finance trips to
the mall to buy things...

440
00:35:57,036 --> 00:36:00,580
...that we think will fill
these holes in our lives.

441
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:03,457
Any wonder we've lost
our sense of direction?

442
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,995
Holy shit!

443
00:37:04,304 --> 00:37:05,263
Right ascension...

444
00:37:05,472 --> 00:37:09,351
...18 hours, 36
minutes, 56.2 seconds!

445
00:37:10,477 --> 00:37:12,143
Declination...

446
00:37:12,437 --> 00:37:15,398
...+ 36 degrees, 46 minutes...

447
00:37:15,774 --> 00:37:17,983
...56.2 seconds!

448
00:37:20,485 --> 00:37:21,946
Confirm!

449
00:37:22,153 --> 00:37:25,240
Right ascension, 18
hours, 36 minutes...

450
00:37:25,406 --> 00:37:27,575
...56.2 seconds!

451
00:37:28,243 --> 00:37:31,079
Is anybody awake in there?
I'm moving the array!

452
00:37:31,288 --> 00:37:33,248
- Confirm!

453
00:37:33,456 --> 00:37:34,957
Boss has a bogey!

454
00:37:35,165 --> 00:37:37,377
Right ascension, 18 hours...

455
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,046
We're on it!

456
00:37:43,256 --> 00:37:44,215
36 hours...

457
00:37:44,674 --> 00:37:46,634
...47 minutes and 1 second!

458
00:37:47,094 --> 00:37:48,428
Strong possible...

459
00:37:48,636 --> 00:37:51,139
...pulse chain
on sub-array four!

460
00:37:51,345 --> 00:37:53,848
I'm moving the rest.
Confirm coordinates!

461
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:56,685
Check the status of the array.

462
00:37:56,977 --> 00:37:58,352
She's doing all the dishes.

463
00:37:58,769 --> 00:37:59,646
Systems nominal.

464
00:38:05,526 --> 00:38:06,651
Hello.

465
00:38:07,904 --> 00:38:08,945
Full systems check!

466
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:12,491
Coordinates confirmed.
Willie's checking the system.

467
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:15,659
Stay on top of the
systems diagnostics!

468
00:38:15,952 --> 00:38:17,662
Check reference point offsets.

469
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:21,874
And I want you off-axis on
27 the second we get there!

470
00:38:22,042 --> 00:38:24,543
And tell Willie to
break out the big boy!

471
00:38:26,127 --> 00:38:27,170
Copy that.

472
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:29,966
Yeah! Go, Ellie!

473
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:33,343
I hear it on the headphones.
We got to be sure about this.

474
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,847
Give me another array status.

475
00:38:37,681 --> 00:38:41,185
Her four are online,
the rest are tracking in.

476
00:38:43,686 --> 00:38:46,023
But there's a bad drive on 16.

477
00:38:46,231 --> 00:38:48,650
The four are online,
the rest are tracking in.

478
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:51,736
There's a bad drive
on 16. Copy that?

479
00:38:53,195 --> 00:38:55,196
What shall I do about
the source queue?

480
00:38:55,405 --> 00:38:57,365
Forget it and hold the queue.

481
00:38:57,699 --> 00:38:59,840
Get ready to set
the target frequency

482
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:01,870
to manual the
second we're aligned.

483
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:03,919
Do you copy? I want you to go

484
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,457
off-axis on 27 the
second we're there!

485
00:39:06,706 --> 00:39:09,336
And leave the LO
frequency where it is!

486
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:12,836
Don't let it get away! If
you lose it, scan the band!

487
00:39:13,047 --> 00:39:15,673
Run every frequency
you can think of.

488
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:22,346
How you doing?

489
00:39:26,935 --> 00:39:28,061
Talk to me, guys.

490
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:31,939
Partially polarized moving
pulses, amplitude modulated.

491
00:39:32,146 --> 00:39:35,817
We're locked. Systems are
fine. What's the frequency?

492
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:37,025
4.46...

493
00:39:37,278 --> 00:39:38,778
...23 gigahertz.

494
00:39:40,572 --> 00:39:42,196
Hydrogen times pi.

495
00:39:42,575 --> 00:39:43,700
Told you!

496
00:39:43,992 --> 00:39:45,659
Strong sucker too!

497
00:39:46,742 --> 00:39:48,286
I got it! I'm patched in!

498
00:39:48,996 --> 00:39:50,037
Let me hear.

499
00:39:55,711 --> 00:39:57,129
Listen to that.

500
00:39:59,424 --> 00:40:01,382
Make me a liar, Fish.

501
00:40:01,841 --> 00:40:04,552
It could be AWACS out
of Kirkland jamming us.

502
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:05,969
But I doubt it.

503
00:40:06,219 --> 00:40:08,389
See if F.U.D.D.'s
reading it too.

504
00:40:10,473 --> 00:40:12,559
Patch it back and
give me the off-axis.

505
00:40:13,185 --> 00:40:14,852
- We recording?
- Never stopped.

506
00:40:16,939 --> 00:40:18,232
Thank you, Elmer!

507
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,233
AWACS status is negative.

508
00:40:20,442 --> 00:40:21,443
White Sands?

509
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,276
On this frequency? No.

510
00:40:23,735 --> 00:40:25,071
I'll punch up the darks.

511
00:40:28,281 --> 00:40:29,449
How's spying tonight?

512
00:40:30,534 --> 00:40:31,868
Come on!

513
00:40:34,246 --> 00:40:36,623
NORAD's not tracking any
snoops in this vector.

514
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:38,457
Shuttle's in sleep mode.

515
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:40,961
Okay, point source confirmed.

516
00:40:41,253 --> 00:40:42,837
Whatever it is, it ain't local.

517
00:40:43,086 --> 00:40:43,878
Position?

518
00:40:44,088 --> 00:40:46,548
I checked interferometry.
Somewhere in Lyra.

519
00:40:46,756 --> 00:40:48,424
- Vega?
- Can't be!

520
00:40:48,634 --> 00:40:50,636
It's only 26 light years away.

521
00:40:50,927 --> 00:40:52,846
- Peak intensity?
- Coming up!

522
00:40:54,096 --> 00:40:54,805
Vega.

523
00:40:55,556 --> 00:40:57,515
Vega. I scanned
it a bunch of times

524
00:40:57,516 --> 00:40:59,476
at Arecibo. It was
always negative.

525
00:40:59,685 --> 00:41:00,686
Got it!

526
00:41:00,811 --> 00:41:02,646
Reading over 100 janskys.

527
00:41:03,395 --> 00:41:05,898
Jesus! I can pick
it up on my...

528
00:41:08,817 --> 00:41:09,818
No!

529
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,101
Come on!

530
00:41:46,352 --> 00:41:47,562
It's restarting.

531
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:50,690
Wait a minute.
Those are numbers.

532
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:52,650
That was 3, before it was 2.

533
00:41:54,151 --> 00:41:56,653
Base 10 numbers. Count
and see how far we get.

534
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,407
One.

535
00:42:05,077 --> 00:42:06,079
Seven.

536
00:42:08,874 --> 00:42:10,416
Those are primes.

537
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:13,836
2, 3, 5, 7 are
all prime numbers.

538
00:42:14,295 --> 00:42:16,171
No way that's a
natural phenomenon!

539
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,216
Let's just calm down and
pull up the star file on Vega.

540
00:42:20,716 --> 00:42:24,012
It doesn't make any sense.
The system is too young.

541
00:42:24,221 --> 00:42:25,847
It can't have a
planetary system...

542
00:42:26,055 --> 00:42:29,308
...let alone life or a
technological civilization.

543
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:32,020
Maybe they're not from
there, they're visiting.

544
00:42:32,227 --> 00:42:35,564
Spacecraft? This system's full
of debris. It'd get clobbered.

545
00:42:35,981 --> 00:42:40,027
Not if they used their laser
blasters and photon torpedoes.

546
00:42:40,361 --> 00:42:43,239
- That's not funny.
- How else can we explain it!

547
00:42:43,738 --> 00:42:46,701
He's right. If we go public
with this and we're wrong...

548
00:42:46,908 --> 00:42:49,202
...it's over. We're cooked.

549
00:42:52,037 --> 00:42:53,372
I wish Kent was here.

550
00:42:53,581 --> 00:42:57,043
Whatever it is, let's do
something. Vega will set.

551
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:04,759
Position confirmed. We've got
4.4623 gigahertz, confirmed.

552
00:43:04,966 --> 00:43:07,761
We've got 112 janskys.

553
00:43:08,093 --> 00:43:10,304
Do you have a
source location yet?

554
00:43:12,848 --> 00:43:15,226
We put it right
smack in the middle.

555
00:43:15,936 --> 00:43:17,185
Vega.

556
00:43:19,394 --> 00:43:22,273
Thanks. Keep tracking
and we'll get back to you.

557
00:43:22,565 --> 00:43:23,733
Right-o.

558
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:36,869
101. The pulse sequenced...

559
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:40,414
...through every prime
number between 2 and 101.

560
00:43:42,374 --> 00:43:44,085
Who do we call now?

561
00:43:47,295 --> 00:43:48,296
Everybody.

562
00:43:56,055 --> 00:43:59,600
The rumors are flying, the
implications extraordinary.

563
00:43:59,766 --> 00:44:01,686
Detection of an unidentified...

564
00:44:01,852 --> 00:44:03,865
...radio source from space can

565
00:44:03,866 --> 00:44:06,147
neither be
confirmed nor denied.

566
00:44:06,397 --> 00:44:08,274
But the military arriving...

567
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:12,070
Sources close to the VLA report
they have been contacted...

568
00:44:12,279 --> 00:44:14,281
...by some form of
intelligent being...

569
00:44:14,446 --> 00:44:16,795
...living outside
our solar system.

570
00:44:16,796 --> 00:44:18,951
Again, there is
no confirmation.

571
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:24,247
I want all of these
people out of here.

572
00:44:25,081 --> 00:44:26,372
Where's the girl?

573
00:44:31,004 --> 00:44:32,336
22 stations worldwide...

574
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:33,963
...now confirm the signal.

575
00:44:34,131 --> 00:44:35,800
Vega's now below our horizon.

576
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,385
You're hearing the
signal from the Russian...

577
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,178
Get decryption people here.

578
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,471
Lunacharsky's
visiting at Cal Tech.

579
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,015
Explain this to me.

580
00:44:44,266 --> 00:44:46,124
If the source of
the signal is so

581
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:48,310
sophisticated... why
the remedial math?

582
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,854
Why not just speak English?

583
00:44:50,103 --> 00:44:53,523
Maybe because 70% of the
planet speaks other languages.

584
00:44:53,648 --> 00:44:56,525
Mathematics is the only
truly universal language.

585
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,695
It's no coincidence that
they're using primes.

586
00:44:59,946 --> 00:45:00,864
I don't get it.

587
00:45:01,197 --> 00:45:02,407
Prime numbers.

588
00:45:02,573 --> 00:45:06,118
Integers only divisible
by themselves and 1.

589
00:45:09,038 --> 00:45:11,873
We think this may be a
beacon, an announcement...

590
00:45:12,165 --> 00:45:13,916
...to get our attention.

591
00:45:14,124 --> 00:45:17,838
If it's attention you want,
you got that. One thing: Vega.

592
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:21,506
People have looked at Vega
for years, with no results.

593
00:45:21,716 --> 00:45:24,676
Yesterday they start
broadcasting primes. Why?

594
00:45:24,887 --> 00:45:26,262
It's hardly yesterday.

595
00:45:26,471 --> 00:45:29,014
The signal's been
transmitting for 26 years.

596
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:31,807
Excuse me, who are you?

597
00:45:32,059 --> 00:45:34,521
Michael Kitz, National
Security Advisor.

598
00:45:34,686 --> 00:45:36,020
Your reputation...

599
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:39,607
First, ask the gentlemen
with the guns to wait outside.

600
00:45:40,316 --> 00:45:42,402
This is a civilian facility.

601
00:45:48,907 --> 00:45:50,368
With all due respect...

602
00:45:50,534 --> 00:45:51,410
Excuse me.

603
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:55,162
Hi! I'm so glad you're back!

604
00:45:55,746 --> 00:45:56,914
Come hear this.

605
00:45:57,666 --> 00:45:58,958
Is this great?

606
00:45:59,166 --> 00:46:01,545
- Who are all these people?
- I have no idea.

607
00:46:01,752 --> 00:46:04,880
Sit down. We need help
with the spectrum analysis.

608
00:46:05,046 --> 00:46:06,716
- I'll get on it.
- Headsets.

609
00:46:06,924 --> 00:46:09,051
I'll just come
right to the point.

610
00:46:09,342 --> 00:46:11,343
Announcing this all
over the world may

611
00:46:11,344 --> 00:46:13,345
well be a breach of
national security.

612
00:46:13,512 --> 00:46:15,223
It's not a
person-to-person call.

613
00:46:15,432 --> 00:46:17,469
You think a
civilization sending this

614
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:19,561
message intends it
just for Americans?

615
00:46:19,726 --> 00:46:21,603
You might have consulted us.

616
00:46:21,936 --> 00:46:23,969
- The contents could
be very sensitive.

617
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:25,900
- You want to
classify prime numbers?

618
00:46:26,567 --> 00:46:28,259
Due to earth's
rotation, we're in

619
00:46:28,261 --> 00:46:29,902
line with Vega
only hours a day.

620
00:46:30,111 --> 00:46:32,219
The only way to
monitor the signal

621
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,447
is to cooperate
with other stations.

622
00:46:34,698 --> 00:46:36,455
If Dr. Arroway hadn't acted

623
00:46:36,456 --> 00:46:38,995
quickly, we'd have
lost key elements.

624
00:46:39,203 --> 00:46:40,746
Fine, they've got the primes.

625
00:46:40,956 --> 00:46:43,748
But if a more significant
transmission is to come...

626
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:45,917
We need help to
receive and decode.

627
00:46:46,127 --> 00:46:48,796
You understand that
my job is to protect...

628
00:46:50,046 --> 00:46:51,966
- Listen.
- I hear it.

629
00:46:52,299 --> 00:46:53,258
Hear what?

630
00:46:53,465 --> 00:46:54,425
Harmonic.

631
00:46:54,634 --> 00:46:58,470
Bingo! I had Willie ask Rattan
to retune to 8.9247 gigahertz.

632
00:46:58,637 --> 00:47:00,265
There's a lot more here.

633
00:47:00,471 --> 00:47:03,100
- Get on the negative sideband.
- I'm already on it.

634
00:47:03,309 --> 00:47:04,435
What is it?

635
00:47:04,642 --> 00:47:06,103
Another signal!

636
00:47:06,312 --> 00:47:09,148
A second signal at double
the frequency. Looks like...

637
00:47:09,981 --> 00:47:11,357
Get a TV monitor!

638
00:47:12,065 --> 00:47:13,943
Patch it into the
image processor.

639
00:47:14,152 --> 00:47:15,445
Want the new data?

640
00:47:15,652 --> 00:47:17,447
Yeah, the new one
we just recorded.

641
00:47:17,654 --> 00:47:19,616
David, explain
this to me, please.

642
00:47:19,823 --> 00:47:22,619
There's another signal.
Looks like a TV transmission.

643
00:47:22,826 --> 00:47:23,784
We're hot.

644
00:47:23,994 --> 00:47:26,746
Go get the blinds.
There is a lot of glare.

645
00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:29,247
You're patched in.

646
00:47:29,499 --> 00:47:32,919
It's definitely an image.
Let's try and stabilize it.

647
00:47:37,671 --> 00:47:39,383
What do you make of that?

648
00:47:39,592 --> 00:47:42,594
It's two different interlaced
frames. I'm framing one.

649
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:48,683
- It's just noise.
- Trying frame two.

650
00:47:49,893 --> 00:47:53,229
I've got an offset
carrier. I think it's audio.

651
00:47:53,436 --> 00:47:54,687
Plug it in!

652
00:47:58,983 --> 00:48:00,277
Center that segment.

653
00:48:00,485 --> 00:48:01,612
Centering.

654
00:48:05,867 --> 00:48:07,159
Can you clean it up?

655
00:48:07,367 --> 00:48:08,826
I'm working on it.

656
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:23,214
What the hell...?

657
00:48:23,965 --> 00:48:25,216
Try zooming out.

658
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,180
Freeze!

659
00:48:30,388 --> 00:48:31,681
Reverse values.

660
00:48:33,307 --> 00:48:35,059
Try zooming out again.

661
00:48:39,062 --> 00:48:41,231
Rotate 90 degrees
counterclock...

662
00:48:42,815 --> 00:48:44,358
My God!

663
00:48:51,072 --> 00:48:52,533
What's going on?

664
00:48:53,075 --> 00:48:55,494
You're not going
to believe this.

665
00:49:08,964 --> 00:49:10,675
Does anybody speak German?

666
00:49:12,092 --> 00:49:14,510
"I declare the
Games in Berlin...

667
00:49:15,595 --> 00:49:17,305
...at the celebration...

668
00:49:17,513 --> 00:49:20,391
...of the first Olympics
of the New Era...

669
00:49:20,642 --> 00:49:21,935
...as opened. "

670
00:49:32,695 --> 00:49:34,112
Get me the White House.

671
00:49:34,945 --> 00:49:37,366
20 million people died
defeating the bastard...

672
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:40,368
...and he's our first
ambassador to outer space?

673
00:49:40,576 --> 00:49:42,249
The broadcast of
the '36 Olympics

674
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,872
was the first TV
transmission...

675
00:49:44,122 --> 00:49:45,581
...that went into space.

676
00:49:45,831 --> 00:49:49,126
Sending it back is a way of
saying, "Hello, we heard you. "

677
00:49:49,377 --> 00:49:51,669
Or, "Sieg Heil, you're
our kind of people. "

678
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,382
Hitler's politics have
nothing to do with this.

679
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:58,218
It's unlikely they understood
it. People must understand...

680
00:49:58,427 --> 00:50:00,804
The people are in very
good hands, Doctor.

681
00:50:00,971 --> 00:50:02,764
We'll take it from here.

682
00:50:03,806 --> 00:50:05,767
Smile, folks. We're on.

683
00:50:06,059 --> 00:50:08,351
A message of unknown
origin from deep space...

684
00:50:08,601 --> 00:50:10,099
...was received by American

685
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,148
scientists. Now
to the White House.

686
00:50:12,689 --> 00:50:15,900
We're told the President will
have only a few remarks...

687
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:17,612
...about today's
extraordinary events...

688
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:21,196
...and that he won't be taking
any questions from the press.

689
00:50:26,202 --> 00:50:27,495
Good afternoon.

690
00:50:30,371 --> 00:50:32,499
I'm glad to be joined by my...

691
00:50:32,706 --> 00:50:34,626
...Science and
Technology Advisor.

692
00:50:36,379 --> 00:50:39,214
This is the product of
years of exploration...

693
00:50:39,421 --> 00:50:42,717
...by some of the world's
most distinguished scientists.

694
00:50:42,926 --> 00:50:44,512
Like all discoveries...

695
00:50:44,761 --> 00:50:47,054
...this one will
continue to be reviewed...

696
00:50:47,262 --> 00:50:48,305
...examined...

697
00:50:48,556 --> 00:50:50,015
...and scrutinized.

698
00:50:50,223 --> 00:50:53,227
It must be confirmed
by other scientists.

699
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,687
But clearly...

700
00:50:55,229 --> 00:50:58,690
...the fact that this is being
explored is a vindication...

701
00:50:59,566 --> 00:51:01,485
Fish, what is the
story over here? I

702
00:51:01,486 --> 00:51:03,403
thought Ellie was
supposed to be on.

703
00:51:03,571 --> 00:51:05,028
I don't know.

704
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:07,071
Guys?

705
00:51:09,408 --> 00:51:12,119
Those interlaced frames
we thought were noise?

706
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,748
This has structure.
I'm hearing structure.

707
00:51:17,124 --> 00:51:19,374
If this discovery
is confirmed...

708
00:51:19,584 --> 00:51:21,109
...it will be one of the most

709
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,212
stunning insights
into our universe...

710
00:51:23,421 --> 00:51:25,464
...that science
has ever uncovered.

711
00:51:26,007 --> 00:51:28,300
Its implications are
as far-reaching...

712
00:51:28,593 --> 00:51:31,135
...and awe-inspiring
as can be imagined.

713
00:51:31,385 --> 00:51:34,806
Even as it promises answers to
some of our oldest questions...

714
00:51:35,056 --> 00:51:36,641
...it poses still others...

715
00:51:36,807 --> 00:51:38,475
...even more fundamental.

716
00:51:38,684 --> 00:51:40,602
We will continue
to listen closely...

717
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:42,313
...to what it has to say...

718
00:51:42,521 --> 00:51:44,607
...as we continue the
search for answers...

719
00:51:44,815 --> 00:51:46,107
...and for knowledge...

720
00:51:46,317 --> 00:51:48,609
...that is as old
as humanity itself...

721
00:51:48,818 --> 00:51:51,737
...but essential to
our people's future.

722
00:51:52,155 --> 00:51:52,864
Thank you.

723
00:51:53,114 --> 00:51:55,991
Is there a renewed
assessment of security threat?

724
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:59,244
I'll answer your questions
after a few corrections.

725
00:51:59,453 --> 00:52:01,205
The message was
received Friday...

726
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:03,456
...at 6:31 a. m.
Mountain Standard Time.

727
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:05,250
It was largely mathematical...

728
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:08,171
...and in spite of
reports to the contrary...

729
00:52:08,461 --> 00:52:11,006
...appears to be
completely benign in nature.

730
00:52:11,173 --> 00:52:15,093
Let me say that again. The
message is completely benign.

731
00:52:15,302 --> 00:52:18,513
The President has contacted
the world's heads of state...

732
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:21,474
...and every security
measure is being taken.

733
00:52:21,724 --> 00:52:24,770
To better explain the events
of the last 48 hours...

734
00:52:24,977 --> 00:52:27,214
...is the leader of
the scientific team

735
00:52:27,215 --> 00:52:29,397
that made this
remarkable discovery...

736
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:31,443
...Dr. David Drumlin, special

737
00:52:31,443 --> 00:52:33,609
Science Advisor
to the President.

738
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,077
Thank you, Rachel.

739
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:44,453
Hello.

740
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,873
In 1936 a very faint
television signal...

741
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:51,305
...transmitted the
opening ceremonies

742
00:52:51,306 --> 00:52:53,293
of the Olympic
Games as a show...

743
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:56,005
...of German
superior technology.

744
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:58,833
That signal left Earth at the

745
00:52:58,834 --> 00:53:01,176
speed of light and
26 years later...

746
00:53:01,426 --> 00:53:05,055
...arrived in the vicinity
of the star we call Vega.

747
00:53:06,265 --> 00:53:10,100
That signal has been sent
back to us hugely amplified...

748
00:53:10,434 --> 00:53:13,396
...an unmistakable
sign of intelligence.

749
00:53:13,604 --> 00:53:14,604
Kent, go ahead.

750
00:53:14,857 --> 00:53:17,114
The Adolf transmission
used 25 frames

751
00:53:17,115 --> 00:53:19,191
per second but
we're receiving 50.

752
00:53:19,401 --> 00:53:23,281
So we put the other 25
through search algorithms.

753
00:53:23,405 --> 00:53:26,073
We found a series of markers
on the top of each frame.

754
00:53:26,284 --> 00:53:28,034
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, go ahead!

755
00:53:28,242 --> 00:53:29,370
Send it, Willie.

756
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,121
Here it comes.

757
00:53:34,415 --> 00:53:35,749
It's digital...

758
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:37,878
...massive amounts
of data which

759
00:53:37,879 --> 00:53:40,088
extend right to the
higher harmonics.

760
00:53:40,797 --> 00:53:42,174
Jackpot!

761
00:53:43,464 --> 00:53:45,424
All right, as you'll see...

762
00:53:45,633 --> 00:53:49,012
...interlaced with the frames
of the original Hitler image...

763
00:53:49,262 --> 00:53:52,098
...we found these sections.

764
00:53:52,306 --> 00:53:55,726
We thought they were noise,
but they're actually data...

765
00:53:55,893 --> 00:53:57,227
...huge amounts of it.

766
00:53:57,436 --> 00:53:59,452
When we combine this with the

767
00:53:59,453 --> 00:54:01,814
data from the
original signal...

768
00:54:01,982 --> 00:54:05,277
...we get these
encrypted pages of text.

769
00:54:05,485 --> 00:54:09,655
No two are alike and we've
uncovered over 10,000 already.

770
00:54:09,822 --> 00:54:11,992
What does it mean, Doctor?

771
00:54:12,408 --> 00:54:15,243
We have no idea. It
could be anything.

772
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:17,579
Volume 1 of an
Encyclopedia Galactica.

773
00:54:17,786 --> 00:54:20,415
Instructions for us on their
colonization procedures.

774
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:22,959
Moses with a few
billion new commandments.

775
00:54:23,125 --> 00:54:25,294
How long will it
take to decode it?

776
00:54:25,503 --> 00:54:28,839
It could take forever.
We really need a primer...

777
00:54:28,964 --> 00:54:32,091
We need to get the best
decryption people we have.

778
00:54:32,801 --> 00:54:36,889
I intend to use the
VLA as my command post.

779
00:54:37,014 --> 00:54:40,601
In the meantime, my office has
made out a preliminary budget.

780
00:54:40,767 --> 00:54:42,099
Wait a minute.

781
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:44,604
This is a
privately-funded operation.

782
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:47,105
We lease dish time
from the government...

783
00:54:47,315 --> 00:54:49,944
This is a clear-cut
case of eminent domain.

784
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:51,888
I'm recommending
to the President

785
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:53,320
we militarize this project.

786
00:54:53,487 --> 00:54:56,032
What?! This is my project!

787
00:54:56,199 --> 00:54:59,534
Nobody knows more about this
than I do. David, tell them...

788
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,746
Excuse me! Could
we calm down here?

789
00:55:02,995 --> 00:55:05,498
I'm going to recommend
that Dr. Drumlin

790
00:55:05,499 --> 00:55:07,625
coordinate the
decryption effort.

791
00:55:07,834 --> 00:55:09,299
But in light of Dr. Arroway's

792
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,170
long experience
in these matters...

793
00:55:11,379 --> 00:55:15,550
...for the time being, she will
direct operations at the VLA...

794
00:55:15,716 --> 00:55:18,172
...understanding that
future discoveries

795
00:55:18,173 --> 00:55:20,388
will be kept in
strict confidence...

796
00:55:20,554 --> 00:55:22,805
...until such time
as the President...

797
00:55:23,055 --> 00:55:26,892
...can decide the most suitable
course of action. Understood?

798
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:28,060
Yes.

799
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:30,563
This is CNN Breaking News.

800
00:55:31,146 --> 00:55:34,106
The President called
the message from Vega...

801
00:55:34,315 --> 00:55:36,442
..."a stunning insight
into our universe... "

802
00:55:36,651 --> 00:55:39,112
Attendance at
religious services has

803
00:55:39,113 --> 00:55:41,572
risen a dramatic
39% in recent days.

804
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:45,576
...as police clashed
with neo-Nazi protesters.

805
00:55:45,825 --> 00:55:47,952
So, there's life
on other planets.

806
00:55:48,162 --> 00:55:51,747
Boy, this will really change
the Miss Universe contest.

807
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:54,248
Health officials worldwide are

808
00:55:54,249 --> 00:55:56,752
concerned that the
message from Vega...

809
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,548
...might trigger a
rash of mass suicides...

810
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:02,382
...not unlike recent cult
deaths near San Diego...

811
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:04,551
Even a scientist must admit...

812
00:56:04,759 --> 00:56:06,970
...there are some
pretty serious

813
00:56:06,971 --> 00:56:09,182
religious overtones
to all this.

814
00:56:09,434 --> 00:56:11,641
Here's someone
whose organization...

815
00:56:11,851 --> 00:56:14,311
...is accused of conducting
its own inquisition:

816
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:17,314
Richard Rank, head of the
Conservative Coalition.

817
00:56:17,522 --> 00:56:18,566
Thank you.

818
00:56:18,773 --> 00:56:21,032
This is yet another
example of science

819
00:56:21,033 --> 00:56:22,943
intruding into
matters of faith.

820
00:56:24,029 --> 00:56:27,363
This means they have been
reacting to TV signals...

821
00:56:27,531 --> 00:56:30,408
...from the 1930's.
They're just getting them.

822
00:56:30,616 --> 00:56:32,170
Imagine how disappointed

823
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:34,370
they'll be if
they're Cubs fans.

824
00:56:34,622 --> 00:56:37,664
We now go to Jeremy
Roth, who is reporting...

825
00:56:37,874 --> 00:56:41,337
...from the Very Large Array
near Socorro, New Mexico.

826
00:56:41,544 --> 00:56:43,046
Like a bolt from
the blue it came.

827
00:56:43,295 --> 00:56:45,255
"The Message from
Vega" has caused...

828
00:56:45,464 --> 00:56:47,883
...thousands of believers
and non-believers...

829
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:49,982
...to descend upon
the VLA facility

830
00:56:49,983 --> 00:56:51,804
here in the desert
of New Mexico.

831
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:54,597
Many have come to
protest, many to pray...

832
00:56:54,806 --> 00:56:57,051
...but most have
come to participate

833
00:56:57,052 --> 00:56:59,477
in what's become the
best show in town.

834
00:57:05,106 --> 00:57:07,609
Well, I saw the thing
coming out of the sky

835
00:57:07,943 --> 00:57:11,070
It had one long
horn and one big eye

836
00:57:11,362 --> 00:57:13,990
I commenced to
shaking and said Oo-ee

837
00:57:14,447 --> 00:57:17,409
Looks like a Purple
People Eater to me

838
00:58:08,539 --> 00:58:10,082
Hail to Vega Hail to Vega

839
00:58:16,046 --> 00:58:17,841
But they have failed!

840
00:58:18,339 --> 00:58:21,134
It's the same people
who, again and again...

841
00:58:21,341 --> 00:58:23,470
...have brought us to
the brink of destruction!

842
00:58:23,721 --> 00:58:27,389
Who've polluted our air,
who've poisoned our water!

843
00:58:28,892 --> 00:58:30,977
Now these scientists...

844
00:58:31,895 --> 00:58:33,855
...have had their chance.

845
00:58:34,062 --> 00:58:37,149
Are these the kind of people...

846
00:58:37,524 --> 00:58:41,361
...that you want talking
to your God for you?

847
00:58:45,281 --> 00:58:47,240
Efforts continue
around the clock.

848
00:58:47,408 --> 00:58:49,322
But for now,
almost 2 full weeks

849
00:58:49,323 --> 00:58:51,121
after the message's arrival...

850
00:58:51,246 --> 00:58:54,539
...scientists here at the
VLA still have no answers...

851
00:58:54,748 --> 00:58:56,502
...only more questions.

852
00:58:56,709 --> 00:59:00,045
Jeremy Roth, CNN,
Socorro, New Mexico.

853
00:59:00,379 --> 00:59:03,758
More on the quest for the
message's meaning, after this.

854
00:59:06,593 --> 00:59:08,386
They have to line up somehow.

855
00:59:08,637 --> 00:59:10,555
This one doesn't fit, either.

856
00:59:10,763 --> 00:59:13,432
We've tried over a
million permutations.

857
00:59:13,641 --> 00:59:16,936
Always, I can only get
three corners to fit.

858
00:59:17,937 --> 00:59:20,107
I don't understand
their significance.

859
01:00:03,561 --> 01:00:04,686
Somebody broke in...

860
01:00:11,152 --> 01:00:12,193
Hello?

861
01:00:13,154 --> 01:00:16,365
Whoever you are, you
broke into the database...

862
01:00:19,326 --> 01:00:20,661
What? Now?

863
01:00:23,496 --> 01:00:24,706
Where?

864
01:00:36,593 --> 01:00:38,594
I'll be there.

865
01:01:06,827 --> 01:01:08,244
You should feel fortunate.

866
01:01:08,913 --> 01:01:10,413
He hardly lands for anyone.

867
01:01:42,152 --> 01:01:43,945
Dr. Arroway.

868
01:01:47,864 --> 01:01:49,200
I presume?

869
01:01:50,452 --> 01:01:51,660
Mr. Hadden.

870
01:01:52,911 --> 01:01:56,163
I've had my eye on you
a long time, Doctor.

871
01:01:56,956 --> 01:02:00,502
I consider you one of my most
valuable long-term investments.

872
01:02:02,336 --> 01:02:04,755
And when it comes
to my investments...

873
01:02:06,506 --> 01:02:09,175
...I always do my homework.

874
01:02:13,846 --> 01:02:15,641
Eleanor Ann Arroway...

875
01:02:15,808 --> 01:02:18,350
...born 25th August, 1964...

876
01:02:18,561 --> 01:02:20,145
...De Pere, Wisconsin.

877
01:02:20,352 --> 01:02:22,136
Mother, Joanna, died from

878
01:02:22,137 --> 01:02:24,566
complications
during childbirth.

879
01:02:25,275 --> 01:02:27,985
Early testing indicated
high predisposition...

880
01:02:28,192 --> 01:02:31,194
...towards science
and mathematics.

881
01:02:31,903 --> 01:02:33,072
Father, Theodore...

882
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:35,145
...advised to
provide enrichment

883
01:02:35,146 --> 01:02:36,783
activities in these areas...

884
01:02:36,993 --> 01:02:39,745
...did so conscientiously
until his death...

885
01:02:39,953 --> 01:02:43,790
...from myocardial
infarction, November 10, 1974.

886
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:48,544
You graduated from
high school in 1979...

887
01:02:48,795 --> 01:02:50,756
...almost two full years early.

888
01:02:52,132 --> 01:02:54,133
Awarded full
scholarship, M.I.T...

889
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,512
...graduated magna cum laude.

890
01:02:57,472 --> 01:02:59,181
Doctoral work, Cal Tech...

891
01:02:59,389 --> 01:03:02,476
...where you worked on the
lanthanide-doped ruby maser...

892
01:03:02,683 --> 01:03:04,717
...dramatically increasing the

893
01:03:04,718 --> 01:03:07,021
sensitivity of
radio telescopes.

894
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,163
Subsequently offered a teaching

895
01:03:09,164 --> 01:03:11,066
position at Harvard
University...

896
01:03:11,273 --> 01:03:14,360
...which you turned down
to pursue SETI work...

897
01:03:14,569 --> 01:03:17,989
...at the Arecibo
Observatory in Puerto Rico.

898
01:03:20,408 --> 01:03:22,911
Changes in N.S.F. policy...

899
01:03:23,286 --> 01:03:26,663
...gave rise to certain
funding problems...

900
01:03:27,748 --> 01:03:29,248
...at which point...

901
01:03:29,749 --> 01:03:31,710
...you came to my attention.

902
01:03:33,045 --> 01:03:35,379
You compromised
our security codes.

903
01:03:37,756 --> 01:03:39,591
Once upon a time...

904
01:03:41,593 --> 01:03:43,678
...I was a hell of an engineer.

905
01:03:44,012 --> 01:03:46,014
Please, sit, Doctor.

906
01:03:46,598 --> 01:03:48,533
I have guests so rarely, it's

907
01:03:48,534 --> 01:03:51,268
important they feel
welcome in my home.

908
01:03:52,311 --> 01:03:53,645
You live here?

909
01:03:55,271 --> 01:03:58,609
I find it convenient
to keep my interests...

910
01:03:59,944 --> 01:04:00,945
...mobile.

911
01:04:03,612 --> 01:04:07,784
Anyway, I've had my fill
of life on the ground.

912
01:04:09,536 --> 01:04:11,036
I guess I should...

913
01:04:11,703 --> 01:04:13,309
I guess I should thank you for

914
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:15,290
having bailed me
out all that time.

915
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:22,756
I know a good bet
when I see one.

916
01:04:25,134 --> 01:04:27,969
Earl Grey. No sugar,
no milk, I believe.

917
01:04:31,307 --> 01:04:33,141
What am I doing here?

918
01:04:43,525 --> 01:04:46,612
The powers that be have
been very busy lately...

919
01:04:47,446 --> 01:04:49,362
...positioning themselves...

920
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:52,324
...for the game
of the millennium.

921
01:04:59,122 --> 01:05:01,751
Maybe I can help
deal you back in.

922
01:05:03,084 --> 01:05:05,420
I didn't realize
that I was out.

923
01:05:06,004 --> 01:05:07,881
No. Maybe not out...

924
01:05:09,006 --> 01:05:11,341
...but certainly
being handed your hat.

925
01:05:16,763 --> 01:05:20,433
I've had a long time
to make enemies, Doctor.

926
01:05:23,978 --> 01:05:25,604
There are many governments...

927
01:05:25,813 --> 01:05:27,397
...business interests...

928
01:05:27,982 --> 01:05:30,068
...even religious
leaders that would

929
01:05:30,069 --> 01:05:31,986
like to see me
depart this earth.

930
01:05:33,487 --> 01:05:35,990
And I'll grant them
their wish soon enough.

931
01:05:36,531 --> 01:05:40,161
But before I do, I wish to
make a small contribution.

932
01:05:40,994 --> 01:05:43,096
A final gesture
of goodwill to the

933
01:05:43,097 --> 01:05:45,499
people of this planet
who have given...

934
01:05:48,375 --> 01:05:51,045
...from whom I
have taken so much.

935
01:05:54,465 --> 01:05:55,966
You found the primer.

936
01:05:58,343 --> 01:05:59,510
Clever girl!

937
01:06:00,677 --> 01:06:01,429
Lights.

938
01:06:10,021 --> 01:06:12,773
Pages and pages of data.

939
01:06:13,398 --> 01:06:16,442
Over 63,000 in all.

940
01:06:16,651 --> 01:06:18,821
And on the perimeter of each...

941
01:06:19,029 --> 01:06:22,614
Alignment symbols, registration
marks, but they don't line up.

942
01:06:23,157 --> 01:06:24,323
They do...

943
01:06:24,616 --> 01:06:26,286
...if you think like a Vegan.

944
01:06:27,245 --> 01:06:30,205
An alien intelligence has
got be more advanced...

945
01:06:30,372 --> 01:06:32,133
...and that means efficiency

946
01:06:32,134 --> 01:06:34,335
functioning on
multiple levels...

947
01:06:34,626 --> 01:06:36,460
...and in multiple...

948
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:38,462
...dimensions.

949
01:06:42,424 --> 01:06:44,427
Yes, of course!

950
01:06:45,011 --> 01:06:46,095
Where's the primer?

951
01:06:46,595 --> 01:06:47,888
You'll see.

952
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:52,934
Every three-dimensional page
contains a piece of the primer.

953
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:58,606
There it was all the time,
staring you in the face.

954
01:06:59,691 --> 01:07:01,394
Buried within the message

955
01:07:01,395 --> 01:07:03,778
itself is the key
to decoding it.

956
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:05,839
Within the layering
of the matrix,

957
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,405
we have these basic equations:

958
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,425
So with this very
elementary foundation,

959
01:07:11,426 --> 01:07:13,162
they have given us a kind of...

960
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:15,829
...general
scientific vocabulary.

961
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:18,292
We now have the symbols
for true and false...

962
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,835
This was the key...

963
01:07:20,042 --> 01:07:22,462
...that allowed us to
decipher their language...

964
01:07:22,711 --> 01:07:26,340
...for physics, geometry,
chemistry. Next frame, Ellie.

965
01:07:27,759 --> 01:07:31,553
Yes, and when we apply this
to the rest of the message...

966
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:33,472
...we find this.

967
01:07:37,933 --> 01:07:39,411
Those look like engineering

968
01:07:39,412 --> 01:07:41,438
schematics, almost
like blueprints.

969
01:07:42,813 --> 01:07:43,814
Yes.

970
01:07:44,106 --> 01:07:45,501
It is our belief that the

971
01:07:45,502 --> 01:07:47,400
message contains
instructions...

972
01:07:47,568 --> 01:07:51,071
...for building something,
some kind of machine.

973
01:07:51,446 --> 01:07:54,157
A machine? That
does what, Doctor?

974
01:07:54,490 --> 01:07:56,700
We don't know. It
might be some type...

975
01:07:57,658 --> 01:07:59,985
...of advanced
communication device,

976
01:07:59,986 --> 01:08:02,247
or a teaching
machine of some kind.

977
01:08:03,748 --> 01:08:05,084
Or it might be...

978
01:08:05,291 --> 01:08:07,044
...some kind of a transport.

979
01:08:07,461 --> 01:08:10,004
- Transport?
- There's no proof of that.

980
01:08:10,214 --> 01:08:13,800
The fact is you don't know what
it does. It could be anything.

981
01:08:14,091 --> 01:08:15,723
A Trojan Horse. We build it and

982
01:08:15,725 --> 01:08:17,512
out pours the
entire Vegan army.

983
01:08:17,804 --> 01:08:20,262
Why risk the personnel?
It could be a weapon.

984
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:22,810
Right. Some kind of
a Doomsday Machine.

985
01:08:23,018 --> 01:08:25,435
Every time they detect
a new civilization...

986
01:08:25,644 --> 01:08:27,938
...they fax construction
plans from space.

987
01:08:28,189 --> 01:08:30,036
We poor saps build
this thing and

988
01:08:30,037 --> 01:08:31,775
blow ourselves to kingdom come.

989
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:35,611
There's no reason to believe
their intentions are hostile.

990
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:39,491
Why is it the egghead position
that aliens are always benign?

991
01:08:40,409 --> 01:08:41,993
We pose no threat to them.

992
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,786
It'd be like us going
out of our way...

993
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:46,747
...to destroy
microbes on an anthill.

994
01:08:46,955 --> 01:08:48,373
Interesting analogy.

995
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:50,672
How guilty would we feel if we

996
01:08:50,673 --> 01:08:52,960
destroyed a few
microbes on an anthill?

997
01:08:53,127 --> 01:08:54,254
I hope you're right.

998
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:55,671
I really do.

999
01:08:55,879 --> 01:08:57,288
But my job is to protect

1000
01:08:57,288 --> 01:08:59,342
American lives
from any threat...

1001
01:08:59,550 --> 01:09:01,677
...so I am obligated
to assume the worst.

1002
01:09:01,885 --> 01:09:03,887
Yes, and I am forced
to agree with you.

1003
01:09:04,095 --> 01:09:05,597
My problem is this:

1004
01:09:06,223 --> 01:09:09,434
The content of that message
is morally ambiguous at best.

1005
01:09:10,101 --> 01:09:11,968
Our internal
numbers show support

1006
01:09:11,969 --> 01:09:13,562
for this is incredibly soft.

1007
01:09:13,772 --> 01:09:16,441
If the President
stays this course...

1008
01:09:16,606 --> 01:09:19,359
...his numbers will be going
south like ducks in winter.

1009
01:09:19,651 --> 01:09:20,694
This is nuts!

1010
01:09:20,944 --> 01:09:21,945
Excuse me...

1011
01:09:22,154 --> 01:09:23,113
...Miss.

1012
01:09:23,614 --> 01:09:26,116
We know nothing of
these creatures' values.

1013
01:09:26,365 --> 01:09:28,952
We don't even know whether
they believe in God.

1014
01:09:29,159 --> 01:09:30,911
This doesn't make
any sense. If...

1015
01:09:31,122 --> 01:09:32,913
Excuse me, Dr. Arroway.

1016
01:09:33,123 --> 01:09:35,623
We won't be suppressing
any opinions here today.

1017
01:09:36,458 --> 01:09:38,584
No, of course
not. I understand.

1018
01:09:39,587 --> 01:09:41,005
What I meant to say...

1019
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:44,842
...is the message was written
in the language of science.

1020
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,845
If it was religious in nature,

1021
01:09:46,846 --> 01:09:48,597
it should have
taken the form...

1022
01:09:48,804 --> 01:09:51,472
...of a burning bush
or a voice from the sky.

1023
01:09:51,681 --> 01:09:53,724
But a voice from the sky...

1024
01:09:54,852 --> 01:09:57,394
...is exactly what you
found, Doctor Arroway.

1025
01:10:01,106 --> 01:10:02,857
I'm sorry I'm late, ma'am.

1026
01:10:04,527 --> 01:10:08,404
I agree with Mr. Rank that
there are unavoidable...

1027
01:10:08,614 --> 01:10:10,783
...religious
implications at stake.

1028
01:10:10,989 --> 01:10:13,409
But that doesn't justify
being an alarmist.

1029
01:10:15,369 --> 01:10:17,789
I hope that we can
find a common ground...

1030
01:10:18,205 --> 01:10:21,251
...break through obstacles
that may have kept us apart.

1031
01:10:22,210 --> 01:10:24,627
Listen, I need to make
one thing very clear.

1032
01:10:24,835 --> 01:10:27,337
Our organization
will not be placated

1033
01:10:27,338 --> 01:10:29,508
with flowery New
Age rhetoric...

1034
01:10:30,257 --> 01:10:31,007
Mr. President!

1035
01:10:33,594 --> 01:10:35,720
The President met
with top advisors...

1036
01:10:35,886 --> 01:10:39,224
...regarding the latest
efforts to decode the message.

1037
01:10:39,433 --> 01:10:41,747
While there has
been some progress,

1038
01:10:41,748 --> 01:10:44,062
the official line
remains cautious.

1039
01:10:44,269 --> 01:10:46,398
If you're asking
when we'll find out...

1040
01:10:46,564 --> 01:10:48,941
...what the purpose
of that Machine is...

1041
01:10:49,941 --> 01:10:52,693
...maybe tomorrow, maybe
next year, maybe never.

1042
01:10:57,115 --> 01:10:59,519
There he is. The
man with his finger

1043
01:10:59,519 --> 01:11:01,661
on the nation's
spiritual pulse.

1044
01:11:03,037 --> 01:11:04,707
It's so good to see you.

1045
01:11:04,957 --> 01:11:05,998
You too.

1046
01:11:07,709 --> 01:11:11,671
Your discovery, all of this.
It must be a real vindication.

1047
01:11:12,339 --> 01:11:13,964
I'm really happy for you.

1048
01:11:14,632 --> 01:11:15,632
Are you?

1049
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,261
Mr. Joss, the
President's waiting.

1050
01:11:21,137 --> 01:11:22,639
The President's waiting.

1051
01:11:27,018 --> 01:11:28,520
See you at the reception?

1052
01:11:29,186 --> 01:11:30,854
Yeah, I wouldn't miss it.

1053
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:45,285
Miss Constantine,
may I speak to you?

1054
01:11:45,493 --> 01:11:46,869
Certainly.

1055
01:11:48,662 --> 01:11:50,289
I have a big problem.

1056
01:11:52,666 --> 01:11:55,293
Do you know where I can
find a really great dress?

1057
01:12:14,811 --> 01:12:16,558
God created man in the form of

1058
01:12:16,559 --> 01:12:18,773
Himself, not in
the form of monkeys!

1059
01:12:27,491 --> 01:12:29,909
Get a job! Don't
waste my tax dollars!

1060
01:12:56,391 --> 01:12:58,017
You look beautiful, Ellie.

1061
01:12:59,728 --> 01:13:02,020
- So do you.
- You really do.

1062
01:13:05,732 --> 01:13:07,193
I read your book.

1063
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:09,360
Here we go.

1064
01:13:09,779 --> 01:13:11,322
You want me to quote you?

1065
01:13:12,114 --> 01:13:13,365
"Ironically...

1066
01:13:13,698 --> 01:13:15,659
...the thing people
are most hungry for...

1067
01:13:15,909 --> 01:13:17,160
...meaning...

1068
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:18,825
...is the one thing science

1069
01:13:18,826 --> 01:13:20,664
hasn't been able
to give them. "

1070
01:13:20,912 --> 01:13:21,871
Yeah.

1071
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:26,168
It's like you're saying that...

1072
01:13:26,461 --> 01:13:28,837
...science killed God.

1073
01:13:29,211 --> 01:13:32,049
What if science
simply revealed...

1074
01:13:32,632 --> 01:13:35,051
...that He never existed
in the first place?

1075
01:13:38,553 --> 01:13:40,722
I think we need
to get some air.

1076
01:13:41,725 --> 01:13:43,517
And a few more of these.

1077
01:13:45,101 --> 01:13:46,270
Thank you.

1078
01:13:48,271 --> 01:13:49,733
A little chilly out here.

1079
01:13:49,982 --> 01:13:51,400
Yeah, this is nice.

1080
01:13:51,775 --> 01:13:52,942
I got one for you.

1081
01:13:53,193 --> 01:13:54,862
Occam's Razor.
Ever heard of it?

1082
01:13:55,111 --> 01:13:57,740
Occam's Razor. Sounds
like some slasher movie.

1083
01:13:57,990 --> 01:13:59,608
No, Occam's Razor is a basic

1084
01:13:59,609 --> 01:14:01,576
scientific
principle which says:

1085
01:14:01,950 --> 01:14:03,649
Things being
equal, the simplest

1086
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:05,246
explanation tends to be right.

1087
01:14:05,498 --> 01:14:06,789
Makes sense to me.

1088
01:14:07,247 --> 01:14:08,373
So what's more likely?

1089
01:14:08,583 --> 01:14:09,541
Thank you.

1090
01:14:10,167 --> 01:14:12,836
An all-powerful God
created the universe...

1091
01:14:13,002 --> 01:14:15,964
...then decided not to give
any proof of His existence?

1092
01:14:16,172 --> 01:14:17,255
Or...

1093
01:14:17,548 --> 01:14:20,760
...that He doesn't exist at
all and that we created Him...

1094
01:14:21,009 --> 01:14:23,553
...so we wouldn't feel
so small and alone.

1095
01:14:24,514 --> 01:14:25,597
I don't know.

1096
01:14:25,889 --> 01:14:29,850
I couldn't imagine living in
a world where God didn't exist.

1097
01:14:30,686 --> 01:14:32,229
I wouldn't want to.

1098
01:14:32,853 --> 01:14:35,231
How do you know you're
not deluding yourself?

1099
01:14:36,106 --> 01:14:37,233
I mean, for me...

1100
01:14:37,399 --> 01:14:39,235
...I'd need proof.

1101
01:14:40,236 --> 01:14:41,237
Proof?

1102
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:46,116
Did you love your father?

1103
01:14:47,201 --> 01:14:48,910
Your dad, did you love him?

1104
01:14:50,078 --> 01:14:52,247
Yes. Very much.

1105
01:14:55,751 --> 01:14:56,917
Prove it.

1106
01:15:04,008 --> 01:15:05,050
Kent.

1107
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,218
The White House.

1108
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:12,398
No excuses.
Whoever's responsible,

1109
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:14,309
I want their head on a platter.

1110
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:15,810
What happened?

1111
01:15:16,477 --> 01:15:17,894
You were right all along.

1112
01:15:18,271 --> 01:15:21,065
The team at the VLA has
worked around the clock...

1113
01:15:21,274 --> 01:15:23,734
...and the hard work
has finally paid off.

1114
01:15:24,318 --> 01:15:26,242
This key section
uncovered tonight,

1115
01:15:26,243 --> 01:15:28,113
and obtained
exclusively by CNN...

1116
01:15:28,279 --> 01:15:30,865
...shows an illustration
of a human figure...

1117
01:15:31,117 --> 01:15:33,951
...inside a geometric
structure of some kind.

1118
01:15:34,119 --> 01:15:35,994
This and other
contextual clues...

1119
01:15:36,245 --> 01:15:37,443
...now lead scientists to

1120
01:15:37,444 --> 01:15:39,165
believe the message
is, in fact...

1121
01:15:39,416 --> 01:15:41,660
- President called
an emergency meeting.

1122
01:15:41,661 --> 01:15:42,917
- I imagined he would.

1123
01:15:43,168 --> 01:15:46,255
...designed to take a single
human occupant into space...

1124
01:15:46,714 --> 01:15:49,008
...presumably to the star Vega.

1125
01:16:12,652 --> 01:16:13,863
Tell me.

1126
01:16:14,404 --> 01:16:15,447
They will build it.

1127
01:16:15,697 --> 01:16:16,490
Who goes?

1128
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,553
The President's
gone international

1129
01:16:18,554 --> 01:16:20,160
to spread the risk and cost...

1130
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:21,286
Who goes?

1131
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:23,746
Well, it's complicated.

1132
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:28,626
They have formed a group
of international candidates.

1133
01:16:28,876 --> 01:16:30,836
Now, it's your discovery.

1134
01:16:31,338 --> 01:16:32,975
They understand that. You're

1135
01:16:32,976 --> 01:16:34,965
at the top of a
very short list.

1136
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:37,886
But they're also forming
a selection committee.

1137
01:16:38,134 --> 01:16:40,481
It's made of
scholars, theologians,

1138
01:16:40,482 --> 01:16:42,304
scientists, philosophers...

1139
01:16:42,514 --> 01:16:43,096
You're on it.

1140
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:45,932
I've been asked, yes.

1141
01:16:48,892 --> 01:16:50,520
I guess that means...

1142
01:16:51,144 --> 01:16:53,981
...that you're a selector,
I'm a selectee and we can't...

1143
01:16:54,231 --> 01:16:55,315
Yeah.

1144
01:16:55,525 --> 01:16:57,818
What you don't
understand, Ellie, is...

1145
01:16:58,151 --> 01:16:59,360
I understand.

1146
01:17:00,904 --> 01:17:02,629
I want you to know, whatever

1147
01:17:02,629 --> 01:17:04,907
happens, as far
as I'm concerned...

1148
01:17:08,493 --> 01:17:09,746
Good luck.

1149
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,646
Whatever you do, make sure he

1150
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:17,586
doesn't monopolize
the committee.

1151
01:17:17,793 --> 01:17:19,796
He is not on the
committee, Ellie.

1152
01:17:23,799 --> 01:17:26,802
He just resigned. He
wants to be the one to go.

1153
01:17:29,012 --> 01:17:32,306
The President is already
feeling the financial pinch.

1154
01:17:32,473 --> 01:17:35,726
Sources say the cost of
the project is spiralling...

1155
01:17:35,936 --> 01:17:38,646
...to more than a third
of a trillion dollars...

1156
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:40,318
...making this perhaps the

1157
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:42,232
most expensive
single project...

1158
01:17:42,401 --> 01:17:44,276
...in all of human history.

1159
01:17:44,527 --> 01:17:46,528
Months of debate
finally reached...

1160
01:17:46,695 --> 01:17:48,590
...a conclusion last week as 10

1161
01:17:48,591 --> 01:17:51,158
candidates were
selected by the I.M.C...

1162
01:17:51,616 --> 01:17:53,340
...representing a cross section

1163
01:17:53,341 --> 01:17:55,288
of political and
religious views.

1164
01:17:55,495 --> 01:17:58,080
Many are the same experts
who have consulted...

1165
01:17:58,331 --> 01:18:00,584
...on the Machine's
design and function.

1166
01:18:00,792 --> 01:18:03,100
They will actively
participate on-site,

1167
01:18:03,101 --> 01:18:05,004
during the
construction process.

1168
01:18:05,504 --> 01:18:06,675
The choice of these 10

1169
01:18:06,676 --> 01:18:08,592
candidates has
been controversial.

1170
01:18:08,799 --> 01:18:11,634
One-third of the
candidates are American.

1171
01:18:11,844 --> 01:18:14,596
And many international
observers ask why.

1172
01:18:15,139 --> 01:18:17,724
The U.S. is shouldering
a large part of the cost...

1173
01:18:17,932 --> 01:18:20,893
Isn't it true that contractors,
like Hadden Industries...

1174
01:18:21,102 --> 01:18:24,397
...are making contributions in
exchange for technology rights?

1175
01:18:24,646 --> 01:18:28,150
Different nations are being
compensated in different ways.

1176
01:18:28,358 --> 01:18:30,598
Japan made headlines
by opting to

1177
01:18:30,599 --> 01:18:32,905
forego candidate
representation...

1178
01:18:33,197 --> 01:18:36,324
...in exchange for the systems
integration subcontract.

1179
01:18:36,574 --> 01:18:38,283
On what basis do you choose...

1180
01:18:38,493 --> 01:18:41,370
...a human being to
represent humanity?

1181
01:18:41,579 --> 01:18:42,704
Good question, Larry.

1182
01:18:42,913 --> 01:18:44,665
If nothing else...

1183
01:18:45,081 --> 01:18:46,975
...it should be
somebody fluent in

1184
01:18:46,976 --> 01:18:49,085
the language the
message was given in.

1185
01:18:49,253 --> 01:18:50,504
Science, in this case.

1186
01:18:51,088 --> 01:18:53,506
Despite your
obvious enthusiasm...

1187
01:18:53,716 --> 01:18:55,924
...there's been a
lot of criticism...

1188
01:18:56,174 --> 01:18:58,803
...that this endeavor
is simply too dangerous.

1189
01:18:59,013 --> 01:19:01,430
Some of that criticism
from scientists.

1190
01:19:01,638 --> 01:19:04,432
One Nobel Prize winner
noted, his words:

1191
01:19:05,225 --> 01:19:06,935
"There is every indication...

1192
01:19:07,144 --> 01:19:09,275
...that this is beyond
our capabilities,

1193
01:19:09,276 --> 01:19:10,938
that this endeavor will fail...

1194
01:19:11,147 --> 01:19:12,950
...and that the
Machine's occupant

1195
01:19:12,951 --> 01:19:14,652
will pay for it
with his life. "

1196
01:19:14,859 --> 01:19:16,612
How do you respond?

1197
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:18,059
This message is from a

1198
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:20,196
civilization that
may be anywhere...

1199
01:19:20,406 --> 01:19:22,319
...from hundreds
to millions and

1200
01:19:22,321 --> 01:19:24,118
millions of years ahead of us.

1201
01:19:24,368 --> 01:19:27,537
I have to believe that an
intelligence that advanced...

1202
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:29,831
...knows what they're doing.

1203
01:19:31,291 --> 01:19:34,627
Now all it requires
on our part is...

1204
01:19:35,294 --> 01:19:36,254
Faith?

1205
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:41,425
I was going to say,
a sense of adventure.

1206
01:19:41,635 --> 01:19:43,094
And in breaking news...

1207
01:19:43,301 --> 01:19:44,719
...astronaut John Russell...

1208
01:19:44,929 --> 01:19:47,026
...considered to be
the leading American

1209
01:19:47,027 --> 01:19:48,765
candidate for the
Machine seat...

1210
01:19:48,975 --> 01:19:51,267
...has dropped
out of the running.

1211
01:19:51,685 --> 01:19:54,727
Russell met with reporters
today at his Houston home.

1212
01:19:55,146 --> 01:19:57,231
I told my dad I
didn't want him...

1213
01:19:57,982 --> 01:19:59,066
...to go.

1214
01:19:59,275 --> 01:20:00,733
Daddy, don't go.

1215
01:20:03,654 --> 01:20:05,406
Nothing would give
me more pride...

1216
01:20:05,613 --> 01:20:06,739
...than to...

1217
01:20:07,408 --> 01:20:09,408
...represent my country.

1218
01:20:09,743 --> 01:20:11,452
But what can I say to this?

1219
01:20:12,368 --> 01:20:16,123
Consortium officials had no
comment, but inside sources...

1220
01:20:16,330 --> 01:20:18,292
...have disclosed
that Dr. Arroway...

1221
01:20:18,499 --> 01:20:20,101
...appears to now be the

1222
01:20:20,102 --> 01:20:22,504
front-runner for
the Machine seat.

1223
01:20:23,628 --> 01:20:26,007
"Meet me at noon. Must talk. "

1224
01:20:26,341 --> 01:20:28,635
I didn't expect a message
like this from you.

1225
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,136
Thanks for coming.

1226
01:20:30,344 --> 01:20:33,305
Is this kosher?
Fraternizing with the enemy?

1227
01:20:33,514 --> 01:20:36,642
Selectors and selectees
mingling around?

1228
01:20:37,184 --> 01:20:38,978
Can we talk about Einstein?

1229
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,104
Yeah, sure.

1230
01:20:41,814 --> 01:20:45,024
Special relativity.
This Machine...

1231
01:20:46,567 --> 01:20:50,656
...if it works, you travel
to Vega at the speed of light.

1232
01:20:50,863 --> 01:20:53,032
- When you come back...
- If you come back.

1233
01:20:55,368 --> 01:20:57,035
If you come back...

1234
01:20:57,537 --> 01:20:59,613
...you'll be 4
years older, but over

1235
01:20:59,614 --> 01:21:01,915
50 years will have
passed here on Earth.

1236
01:21:01,999 --> 01:21:03,374
Basically.

1237
01:21:04,209 --> 01:21:06,711
And everybody that
you care about...

1238
01:21:07,712 --> 01:21:10,005
...will be gone,
dead and buried.

1239
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,552
If you came back, if
you survived at all...

1240
01:21:16,178 --> 01:21:19,972
Look, Palmer, nobody's
saying this isn't dangerous.

1241
01:21:20,183 --> 01:21:22,351
The rest of the
candidates and myself

1242
01:21:22,353 --> 01:21:24,351
understand the
risks we're taking.

1243
01:21:24,518 --> 01:21:25,478
Why?

1244
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:28,481
It's a historic opportunity.
The world needs...

1245
01:21:28,689 --> 01:21:31,359
You, Ellie. You!
You personally.

1246
01:21:32,361 --> 01:21:35,153
By doing this, you're
willing to give your life.

1247
01:21:35,363 --> 01:21:37,531
You're willing to die for it.

1248
01:21:39,366 --> 01:21:40,574
Why?

1249
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:48,082
From as long as I can remember,
I've been searching for...

1250
01:21:48,749 --> 01:21:50,375
...something...

1251
01:21:50,626 --> 01:21:52,306
...some reason why we're here.

1252
01:21:52,307 --> 01:21:54,381
What are we doing
here? Who are we?

1253
01:21:55,381 --> 01:21:59,260
If this is a chance to find out
even a part of that answer...

1254
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:03,764
I don't know, I think
it's worth a human life.

1255
01:22:04,472 --> 01:22:05,598
Don't you?

1256
01:22:12,479 --> 01:22:15,150
You're an incredibly
brave woman, Ellie.

1257
01:22:17,902 --> 01:22:19,777
Or incredibly nuts.

1258
01:22:49,513 --> 01:22:51,348
I'm really confused.

1259
01:22:52,683 --> 01:22:53,933
So am I.

1260
01:22:55,143 --> 01:22:58,771
I think I speak for us all when
I thank you for your patience.

1261
01:22:59,022 --> 01:23:02,441
Myself, I have one final
question, Dr. Arroway.

1262
01:23:03,984 --> 01:23:06,278
If you should meet
these Vegans...

1263
01:23:06,486 --> 01:23:10,823
...and were permitted only
one question to ask of them...

1264
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:12,659
...what would it be?

1265
01:23:14,202 --> 01:23:16,036
I suppose it would be:

1266
01:23:16,286 --> 01:23:17,955
"How did you do it?

1267
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:20,525
How did you evolve? How did you

1268
01:23:20,526 --> 01:23:22,960
survive technological
adolescence...

1269
01:23:23,126 --> 01:23:25,089
...without
destroying yourself?"

1270
01:23:25,797 --> 01:23:28,204
That more than any
other question is

1271
01:23:28,205 --> 01:23:30,674
one I personally
would like answered.

1272
01:23:31,009 --> 01:23:32,843
Not too bad, Mike.

1273
01:23:33,553 --> 01:23:34,805
I join Dr. Bergeron...

1274
01:23:35,013 --> 01:23:38,475
...in expressing thanks for
your patience, Dr. Arroway.

1275
01:23:38,642 --> 01:23:41,185
We're all impressed
with your candor...

1276
01:23:41,521 --> 01:23:43,063
...and your stamina.

1277
01:23:43,522 --> 01:23:46,899
I think we're ready to move
on to your final statement.

1278
01:23:47,066 --> 01:23:48,984
I have one more question.

1279
01:23:49,193 --> 01:23:50,736
Yes, Mr. Joss.

1280
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:57,074
Would you consider yourself...

1281
01:23:57,574 --> 01:23:59,911
...a spiritual person?

1282
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:07,584
I don't understand the
point of the question.

1283
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:11,712
I consider myself
a moral person.

1284
01:24:11,879 --> 01:24:14,041
We're sure that's the case, but

1285
01:24:14,042 --> 01:24:16,551
what Mr. Joss is
in fact asking...

1286
01:24:16,676 --> 01:24:18,552
Do you believe in God?

1287
01:24:27,059 --> 01:24:29,228
As a scientist...

1288
01:24:29,562 --> 01:24:33,066
...I rely on empirical
evidence, and in this matter...

1289
01:24:33,357 --> 01:24:36,735
...I don't believe that
there's data either way.

1290
01:24:37,526 --> 01:24:41,532
So your answer would in fact be
that you don't believe in God.

1291
01:24:45,411 --> 01:24:48,456
I don't understand the
relevance of the question.

1292
01:24:51,416 --> 01:24:54,419
95% of the world's
population...

1293
01:24:54,627 --> 01:24:58,422
...believes in a Supreme
Being in one form or another.

1294
01:24:59,591 --> 01:25:02,760
I believe that makes the
question more than relevant.

1295
01:25:17,148 --> 01:25:18,733
I believe...

1296
01:25:23,112 --> 01:25:25,655
I believe I've already
answered that question.

1297
01:25:29,657 --> 01:25:33,079
I'm proud of what we've
achieved as a species...

1298
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:35,332
...and as a civilization.

1299
01:25:36,956 --> 01:25:39,627
I would hate to see
everything we stand for...

1300
01:25:39,794 --> 01:25:43,588
...all that we have fought for
for a thousand generations...

1301
01:25:43,756 --> 01:25:46,131
...all that God has
blessed us with...

1302
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:49,010
...betrayed...

1303
01:25:49,968 --> 01:25:52,194
...in the final
hour because we sent

1304
01:25:52,195 --> 01:25:54,597
a representative who
did not put our...

1305
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:57,850
...most cherished
beliefs first.

1306
01:26:01,146 --> 01:26:02,313
Thank you.

1307
01:26:35,552 --> 01:26:36,888
Why'd you do it?

1308
01:26:41,474 --> 01:26:45,604
Our job was to select someone
to speak for everybody.

1309
01:26:49,023 --> 01:26:52,234
I couldn't in good conscience
vote for a person...

1310
01:26:52,526 --> 01:26:54,529
...who doesn't believe in God.

1311
01:26:56,572 --> 01:26:57,989
Someone who...

1312
01:26:58,406 --> 01:27:01,534
...honestly thinks
the other 95% of us...

1313
01:27:01,742 --> 01:27:04,537
...suffer from some
form of mass delusion.

1314
01:27:07,872 --> 01:27:09,958
I told the truth up there.

1315
01:27:11,252 --> 01:27:14,714
Drumlin told you exactly
what you wanted to hear.

1316
01:27:49,912 --> 01:27:52,538
With full humility
and utmost gratitude...

1317
01:27:52,749 --> 01:27:54,874
...I accept this great honor...

1318
01:27:55,085 --> 01:27:59,128
...and I promise I will do my
best to represent my nation...

1319
01:27:59,295 --> 01:28:02,800
...my planet and my
God on this historic...

1320
01:28:02,965 --> 01:28:04,049
...journey.

1321
01:28:04,592 --> 01:28:06,927
I thank you from the
bottom of my heart.

1322
01:28:49,508 --> 01:28:52,511
There's a carnival atmosphere
at Cape Canaveral...

1323
01:28:52,678 --> 01:28:54,805
...as the International
Machine Consortium...

1324
01:28:55,013 --> 01:28:58,349
...hosts as much a media
event as a systems test.

1325
01:28:58,810 --> 01:29:00,466
David Drumlin is supervising

1326
01:29:00,467 --> 01:29:02,477
the on-site
portion of the test.

1327
01:29:02,688 --> 01:29:04,521
We spoke with
him earlier today.

1328
01:29:04,814 --> 01:29:07,162
We'll be able to
monitor the stresses

1329
01:29:07,163 --> 01:29:09,693
and effects using
the robot passenger...

1330
01:29:10,194 --> 01:29:12,487
...who we lovingly call Elmer.

1331
01:29:18,242 --> 01:29:20,703
The press wants to ask
you a few questions...

1332
01:29:20,954 --> 01:29:23,580
...as soon as they're
done with Dr. Drumlin.

1333
01:29:26,168 --> 01:29:28,595
When we release the
pod, a substantial

1334
01:29:28,596 --> 01:29:30,837
amount of energy
will be generated.

1335
01:29:31,670 --> 01:29:34,257
We'll be able to monitor
the stresses and effects...

1336
01:29:34,507 --> 01:29:36,842
...using our robot
passenger, who we...

1337
01:29:37,134 --> 01:29:39,178
...lovingly call Elmer.

1338
01:29:39,803 --> 01:29:40,805
Thank you.

1339
01:29:41,055 --> 01:29:42,348
You're welcome.

1340
01:29:43,724 --> 01:29:46,018
They're ready for
you out at the site.

1341
01:29:46,684 --> 01:29:48,352
Yeah, just a minute.

1342
01:29:54,359 --> 01:29:56,692
- Congratulations.
- Glad you could come.

1343
01:29:58,071 --> 01:30:00,405
Didn't expect to see you here.

1344
01:30:01,198 --> 01:30:03,032
Well, I'm still...

1345
01:30:03,367 --> 01:30:06,037
...Crew Ops at
the Control Center.

1346
01:30:06,746 --> 01:30:08,846
I suppose the fact
that I discovered

1347
01:30:08,846 --> 01:30:10,832
the message means
I have PR value.

1348
01:30:11,041 --> 01:30:12,376
Of course.

1349
01:30:14,169 --> 01:30:17,296
I know you must think
this is all very unfair.

1350
01:30:17,922 --> 01:30:19,881
And maybe that's
an understatement.

1351
01:30:21,384 --> 01:30:23,677
What you don't
know is, I agree.

1352
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:25,684
I wish the world was a place

1353
01:30:25,685 --> 01:30:27,514
where fair was
the bottom line...

1354
01:30:27,681 --> 01:30:29,400
...where the
idealism you showed

1355
01:30:29,401 --> 01:30:31,018
at the hearing was rewarded...

1356
01:30:31,267 --> 01:30:33,394
...not taken advantage of.

1357
01:30:35,147 --> 01:30:37,898
Unfortunately, we don't
live in that world.

1358
01:30:40,234 --> 01:30:41,360
Funny...

1359
01:30:42,779 --> 01:30:45,947
...I always believed the
world is what we make of it.

1360
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:48,784
Excuse me!

1361
01:30:52,745 --> 01:30:54,246
Good luck on the test.

1362
01:30:54,955 --> 01:30:56,124
Thank you.

1363
01:31:04,673 --> 01:31:05,715
Test director...

1364
01:31:05,924 --> 01:31:08,175
...everything looks
good. Ready to go.

1365
01:31:08,635 --> 01:31:11,721
I want things double
and triple checked here.

1366
01:31:11,928 --> 01:31:15,181
We only get one shot at
this. Let's get it right.

1367
01:31:15,641 --> 01:31:18,727
Ladies and gentlemen, we
are ready for start-up.

1368
01:31:18,977 --> 01:31:22,313
All controllers, I need a
go-no-go for test initiation.

1369
01:31:22,439 --> 01:31:23,440
- Mechanical?
- Go.

1370
01:31:23,605 --> 01:31:24,606
Electrical?

1371
01:31:24,773 --> 01:31:25,858
Dynamics?

1372
01:31:26,109 --> 01:31:27,277
Communications?

1373
01:31:27,445 --> 01:31:28,570
Pod systems?

1374
01:31:28,819 --> 01:31:29,989
Safety?

1375
01:31:30,448 --> 01:31:33,283
Crew Ops, verify all pre-test
procedures are complete.

1376
01:31:33,490 --> 01:31:34,992
Yes, verified. I'm go.

1377
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:37,662
Pad Leader, is
everything okay with you?

1378
01:31:37,829 --> 01:31:40,457
Roger. The pad is a go.

1379
01:31:40,664 --> 01:31:43,459
Test initiation, on my mark.

1380
01:31:43,917 --> 01:31:45,127
5...

1381
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:46,670
...4...

1382
01:31:47,086 --> 01:31:48,297
...3...

1383
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:49,504
...2...

1384
01:31:50,089 --> 01:31:51,132
...1.

1385
01:31:51,673 --> 01:31:52,799
Mark.

1386
01:31:53,342 --> 01:31:55,178
- Test start.
- Rings are unlocked.

1387
01:31:55,345 --> 01:31:56,887
Power levels show a good start.

1388
01:31:57,138 --> 01:31:58,889
We've begun the test of...

1389
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:01,515
...earth's first
system built by sharing

1390
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:03,602
knowledge with a
neighbor in space.

1391
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:06,103
All power sources on
core induction bus.

1392
01:32:06,312 --> 01:32:08,022
IPV power transfer.

1393
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:11,359
Ring motion detect.
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie.

1394
01:32:12,985 --> 01:32:16,029
- Gerry, how are we looking?
- Looks good. We're underway.

1395
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:18,031
Looks like a normal start-up.

1396
01:32:18,198 --> 01:32:20,534
Roger, David. It's
looking good here.

1397
01:32:26,121 --> 01:32:27,667
We are moments away from the

1398
01:32:27,668 --> 01:32:29,541
initiation of
the drop sequence.

1399
01:32:29,708 --> 01:32:31,502
All systems are go.

1400
01:32:34,504 --> 01:32:36,299
- Mechanical, you still happy?
- Roger.

1401
01:32:36,506 --> 01:32:37,758
It's very exciting...

1402
01:32:37,965 --> 01:32:39,549
...from up here.

1403
01:32:41,885 --> 01:32:43,638
We've got 4%.

1404
01:32:43,845 --> 01:32:45,639
We're confirming 4%.

1405
01:32:46,890 --> 01:32:49,519
Frequency 9.85.

1406
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:52,520
Harmonics in the green.

1407
01:32:52,773 --> 01:32:55,108
G-level 1.1.

1408
01:32:56,232 --> 01:32:59,611
- 5%.
- Confirmed. We are at 5%.

1409
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:01,405
David, how's it looking to you?

1410
01:33:01,738 --> 01:33:04,699
Okay. I'm going to take a
look and show you what we got.

1411
01:33:04,908 --> 01:33:06,700
Instrumentation looks good.

1412
01:33:06,909 --> 01:33:10,372
We have a good picture
from Dr. Drumlin's PRD.

1413
01:33:10,913 --> 01:33:13,374
Hope you guys are
seeing what I'm seeing.

1414
01:33:13,874 --> 01:33:15,709
All systems are go.

1415
01:33:17,292 --> 01:33:18,796
This is really something!

1416
01:33:19,004 --> 01:33:20,587
For purposes of this test...

1417
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:22,959
...Dr. Drumlin will
be on top of the

1418
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:25,134
Gantry crane that's
over the Machine.

1419
01:33:25,385 --> 01:33:27,387
We've got some
video animation...

1420
01:33:27,554 --> 01:33:29,523
...to show just
how this Machine...

1421
01:33:29,525 --> 01:33:31,055
it is thought... will work.

1422
01:33:31,307 --> 01:33:32,932
The passenger pod will release.

1423
01:33:33,142 --> 01:33:35,317
It will come down
through the center of

1424
01:33:35,318 --> 01:33:37,438
the rings and into
the Machine's core.

1425
01:33:37,730 --> 01:33:40,063
The question everyone
here is asking is...

1426
01:33:40,272 --> 01:33:41,773
...what happens then?

1427
01:33:42,108 --> 01:33:44,473
Some believe the
rings function as some

1428
01:33:44,474 --> 01:33:46,778
sort of an accelerator
or something...

1429
01:33:47,571 --> 01:33:49,698
...sending its
energy into the pod...

1430
01:33:49,906 --> 01:33:52,409
...making it rocket
away at near light speed.

1431
01:33:52,617 --> 01:33:54,661
Others believe it might open up

1432
01:33:54,663 --> 01:33:57,038
a doorway to some
other dimension.

1433
01:33:57,413 --> 01:33:58,413
Who's right?

1434
01:33:58,623 --> 01:34:01,083
That's what today's
test is all about.

1435
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:03,627
- 35%.
- Subsystems ready?

1436
01:34:03,794 --> 01:34:05,754
40% normal acceleration.

1437
01:34:05,963 --> 01:34:07,296
Confirm 40%.

1438
01:34:07,505 --> 01:34:10,468
Controllers stand by to
initiate drop sequence...

1439
01:34:10,634 --> 01:34:12,262
...on my mark.

1440
01:34:12,469 --> 01:34:14,596
All systems ready
for drop sequence.

1441
01:34:14,846 --> 01:34:16,432
45%.

1442
01:34:17,307 --> 01:34:19,434
We're in 45%.

1443
01:34:20,393 --> 01:34:22,436
Verify closure.

1444
01:34:23,772 --> 01:34:25,105
46.

1445
01:34:25,482 --> 01:34:28,023
All controllers
stand by to initiate

1446
01:34:28,024 --> 01:34:30,152
IPV drop sequence. On my mark.

1447
01:34:30,819 --> 01:34:32,154
48%.

1448
01:34:33,488 --> 01:34:35,615
I'm feeling a very
strange vibration.

1449
01:34:36,075 --> 01:34:37,754
- Are you feeling
it down there?

1450
01:34:37,755 --> 01:34:39,077
- Gerry, can you confirm?

1451
01:34:39,660 --> 01:34:40,952
Everything looks good.

1452
01:34:41,662 --> 01:34:42,665
Crew Ops?

1453
01:34:42,830 --> 01:34:43,748
Nothing wrong.

1454
01:34:43,914 --> 01:34:45,582
We see nothing abnormal here.

1455
01:34:45,792 --> 01:34:48,668
No good. Hold sequence.
I'll take a direct reading.

1456
01:34:49,126 --> 01:34:50,504
What's he talking about?

1457
01:34:50,712 --> 01:34:52,380
Can anyone say grandstanding?

1458
01:34:52,673 --> 01:34:54,632
He sure knows he's on TV!

1459
01:34:54,883 --> 01:34:57,844
Back home that's what we
call an overcooked ham.

1460
01:34:58,303 --> 01:35:00,471
I'm reading 10 kilohertz!

1461
01:35:00,804 --> 01:35:03,598
What do you read on the first
and second order G-levels?

1462
01:35:03,806 --> 01:35:05,434
G-levels are right on!

1463
01:35:07,311 --> 01:35:10,188
We confirm Drumlin's
readings. All normal. We're go.

1464
01:35:11,481 --> 01:35:14,148
I think we're okay, but
we'll let him finish.

1465
01:35:15,485 --> 01:35:18,821
- Mechanical, you still okay?
- Roger. Right on the money.

1466
01:35:19,238 --> 01:35:20,446
Security problem!

1467
01:35:21,824 --> 01:35:23,491
Ellie, are you sure?

1468
01:35:24,076 --> 01:35:25,702
He shouldn't be
there. I know him.

1469
01:35:25,911 --> 01:35:28,705
Gerry, execute the
rapid shutdown sequence.

1470
01:35:28,997 --> 01:35:32,209
Security, move emergency
response team into position.

1471
01:35:32,418 --> 01:35:34,253
Get Drumlin on a secure loop.

1472
01:35:34,545 --> 01:35:35,880
You got him.

1473
01:35:36,087 --> 01:35:38,589
- Can you hear me?
- Yes, I hear.

1474
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:41,175
We've got a
security breach here.

1475
01:35:41,551 --> 01:35:42,509
Behind you.

1476
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:43,635
The tall guy.

1477
01:35:44,052 --> 01:35:45,386
The technician.

1478
01:35:45,722 --> 01:35:46,847
See him?

1479
01:35:49,349 --> 01:35:50,559
He shouldn't be there.

1480
01:35:56,690 --> 01:35:58,066
Something's in his hand!

1481
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:02,068
Him! Take him! Security breach!

1482
01:36:02,402 --> 01:36:03,236
A bomb!

1483
01:36:03,570 --> 01:36:06,907
I want that emergency response
team up on the gantry. Now!

1484
01:36:07,239 --> 01:36:08,242
Stage One Alert!

1485
01:36:08,407 --> 01:36:11,202
Move all fire and rescue
personnel into position one.

1486
01:36:49,446 --> 01:36:51,571
All right, back
to your stations.

1487
01:36:51,782 --> 01:36:54,868
I need you to be
professional. Settle down!

1488
01:36:55,078 --> 01:36:57,578
Pad Leader, do you copy?

1489
01:37:15,512 --> 01:37:18,055
The scene earlier today,
when David Drumlin...

1490
01:37:18,262 --> 01:37:20,140
...advisor to two Presidents...

1491
01:37:20,349 --> 01:37:21,966
...and winner of the National

1492
01:37:21,967 --> 01:37:24,143
Academy of Sciences
lifetime award...

1493
01:37:24,477 --> 01:37:28,190
...was laid to rest at
Arlington National Cemetery.

1494
01:37:32,025 --> 01:37:33,735
In a related story...

1495
01:37:33,986 --> 01:37:35,278
Can I help you?

1496
01:37:37,281 --> 01:37:39,157
I've got some mail for you.

1497
01:37:39,616 --> 01:37:41,808
...the apparent
suicide note of the

1498
01:37:41,809 --> 01:37:44,121
terrorist now
believed responsible...

1499
01:37:44,327 --> 01:37:47,290
...for the explosion
in Florida this week.

1500
01:37:47,665 --> 01:37:49,166
What we do...

1501
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:52,461
...we do for the
goodness of all mankind.

1502
01:37:53,169 --> 01:37:56,006
This won't be
understood, not now...

1503
01:37:56,506 --> 01:37:58,174
...but the
Apocalypse to come...

1504
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:01,509
...will vindicate our faith.

1505
01:38:25,826 --> 01:38:26,702
Welcome home.

1506
01:39:33,429 --> 01:39:34,887
Comrade Arroway...

1507
01:39:35,931 --> 01:39:39,308
...we have been expecting
your call. One moment, please.

1508
01:39:49,026 --> 01:39:50,236
Mr. Hadden?

1509
01:39:50,861 --> 01:39:52,154
Doctor!

1510
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:55,115
How kind of you to call.

1511
01:39:55,824 --> 01:39:57,784
Mr. Hadden, where are you?

1512
01:39:59,953 --> 01:40:02,448
The Russian government
was kind enough

1513
01:40:02,449 --> 01:40:04,624
to give me
accommodations on Mir.

1514
01:40:05,582 --> 01:40:07,459
You're living on
a space station?

1515
01:40:08,794 --> 01:40:10,754
It's quite simple, really.

1516
01:40:12,214 --> 01:40:15,674
The low oxygen, zero
gravity environment...

1517
01:40:15,926 --> 01:40:18,033
...is the only thing keeping

1518
01:40:18,034 --> 01:40:20,596
the cancer from
eating me alive.

1519
01:40:22,222 --> 01:40:24,891
Actually, I quite
like it up here.

1520
01:40:25,434 --> 01:40:28,602
My little room has
one hell of a view.

1521
01:40:36,735 --> 01:40:38,571
I want to show you something.

1522
01:40:43,199 --> 01:40:45,201
Hokkaido Island.

1523
01:40:46,578 --> 01:40:48,831
The systems integration site.

1524
01:40:49,873 --> 01:40:51,498
Look closer.

1525
01:40:59,798 --> 01:41:02,636
First rule in
government spending:

1526
01:41:03,594 --> 01:41:07,473
Why build one when you can
have two at twice the price?

1527
01:41:07,849 --> 01:41:10,851
Only, this one
can be kept secret.

1528
01:41:11,477 --> 01:41:13,478
Controlled by Americans...

1529
01:41:13,938 --> 01:41:17,272
...built by Japanese
subcontractors...

1530
01:41:18,233 --> 01:41:20,901
...who also happen to be...

1531
01:41:21,859 --> 01:41:23,529
...recently acquired...

1532
01:41:24,071 --> 01:41:26,532
...wholly-owned
subsidiaries...

1533
01:41:27,366 --> 01:41:29,367
...of Hadden Industries.

1534
01:41:32,996 --> 01:41:36,164
They still want an
American to go, Doctor.

1535
01:41:39,919 --> 01:41:41,544
Want to take a ride?

1536
01:42:24,166 --> 01:42:26,168
Augmenting our restraint and...

1537
01:42:26,419 --> 01:42:28,546
...communications
console subsystem...

1538
01:42:28,712 --> 01:42:30,715
...is your personal
recording unit.

1539
01:42:31,007 --> 01:42:34,510
Normal, infrared and
ultraviolet lenses.

1540
01:42:35,177 --> 01:42:36,893
Digital microchip good for

1541
01:42:36,894 --> 01:42:39,140
thousands of
hours of recording.

1542
01:42:40,433 --> 01:42:42,600
Okay, look, I understand...

1543
01:42:42,851 --> 01:42:46,186
...the reason for recording
and documenting the mission.

1544
01:42:46,354 --> 01:42:48,940
But I just want to go
on record one more time.

1545
01:42:49,189 --> 01:42:50,740
The transmitted specs never

1546
01:42:50,741 --> 01:42:52,693
said anything
about any chair...

1547
01:42:52,943 --> 01:42:54,821
...or a restraining harness...

1548
01:42:55,030 --> 01:42:57,032
...or survival gear.

1549
01:42:57,740 --> 01:42:59,533
Why can't we just
trust the original...

1550
01:42:59,741 --> 01:43:01,801
Doctor, both the
IMC Board and the

1551
01:43:01,802 --> 01:43:03,746
SI team reviewed
the material...

1552
01:43:03,912 --> 01:43:07,456
...and concluded that the
design impact is negligible.

1553
01:43:07,832 --> 01:43:09,374
Bottom line is...

1554
01:43:09,959 --> 01:43:12,085
...we're not putting anyone
aboard this Machine...

1555
01:43:12,294 --> 01:43:15,297
...unless there is some
sort of minimal protection.

1556
01:43:15,631 --> 01:43:16,964
End of story.

1557
01:43:23,970 --> 01:43:25,918
We've given these
to the astronauts

1558
01:43:25,919 --> 01:43:27,976
since the start of
the space program.

1559
01:43:29,309 --> 01:43:31,603
It's never been made
public, of course.

1560
01:43:31,812 --> 01:43:33,897
It's fast and it's painless.

1561
01:43:36,650 --> 01:43:39,653
I'm going to travel 26 light
years to commit suicide?

1562
01:43:39,902 --> 01:43:41,571
Something may go wrong.

1563
01:43:42,155 --> 01:43:44,825
There may be an unforeseen
mechanical failure.

1564
01:43:45,576 --> 01:43:48,661
You could be marooned,
unable to return.

1565
01:43:49,828 --> 01:43:52,957
There are 1,000 reasons we
can think of to have this...

1566
01:43:53,166 --> 01:43:56,085
...but mostly it's for the
reasons we can't think of.

1567
01:44:22,608 --> 01:44:23,776
Come in.

1568
01:44:25,277 --> 01:44:27,613
Dr. Arroway, time to get ready.

1569
01:44:27,862 --> 01:44:28,864
Thank you.

1570
01:44:39,957 --> 01:44:41,710
I know there's not much time.

1571
01:44:41,874 --> 01:44:44,921
As soon as I found out about
it, I called the President.

1572
01:44:45,129 --> 01:44:46,797
I came with Kitz.

1573
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:49,632
I had to see you one more time.

1574
01:44:49,881 --> 01:44:51,552
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

1575
01:44:51,969 --> 01:44:53,720
No, I'm glad you came.

1576
01:44:53,971 --> 01:44:56,222
There's something
I got to say to you.

1577
01:44:57,557 --> 01:44:59,534
The reason I
didn't vote for you

1578
01:44:59,535 --> 01:45:01,810
was a good one, but
not the real one.

1579
01:45:02,896 --> 01:45:04,897
I didn't vote for you to go...

1580
01:45:06,775 --> 01:45:08,610
...because I don't
want to lose you.

1581
01:45:09,737 --> 01:45:11,903
Now you find your
way home, all right?

1582
01:45:28,877 --> 01:45:30,295
23 hours ago, the world...

1583
01:45:30,545 --> 01:45:32,480
...was stunned by
the announcement

1584
01:45:32,481 --> 01:45:34,633
of the existence of
another Machine...

1585
01:45:34,842 --> 01:45:37,802
...and its passenger,
Eleanor Ann Arroway.

1586
01:45:38,011 --> 01:45:38,594
Now...

1587
01:45:39,219 --> 01:45:41,640
...the question that's
on everyone's mind:

1588
01:45:41,848 --> 01:45:43,598
Will history repeat itself?

1589
01:45:44,016 --> 01:45:46,352
With a piece of
engineering this complex...

1590
01:45:46,518 --> 01:45:50,564
...with so many unknowns,
could the unthinkable occur?

1591
01:45:50,772 --> 01:45:54,108
The security in Hokkaido
has been incredibly tight.

1592
01:45:54,275 --> 01:45:57,654
No reporters whatsoever have
been allowed near the site.

1593
01:48:38,174 --> 01:48:41,177
Restraint secure. Life
support functions normal.

1594
01:48:41,386 --> 01:48:42,262
Roger.

1595
01:48:42,470 --> 01:48:44,471
This is Control. Do you copy?

1596
01:48:44,682 --> 01:48:46,182
Reading you
five-by-five.

1597
01:48:47,224 --> 01:48:48,642
Give me Ellie's PRD.

1598
01:48:48,892 --> 01:48:50,894
Video unit recording
and transmitting.

1599
01:48:52,272 --> 01:48:54,856
- Are you reading me?
- That's affirmative.

1600
01:48:55,065 --> 01:48:56,733
Video looks good.

1601
01:48:57,568 --> 01:48:58,693
Copy, Control.

1602
01:49:00,111 --> 01:49:02,905
Ellie, we're going to
proceed to button you up.

1603
01:49:04,782 --> 01:49:05,949
I'm ready.

1604
01:49:09,788 --> 01:49:11,664
Confirming walkway retraction.

1605
01:49:12,372 --> 01:49:13,791
- Communications?
- Go.

1606
01:49:13,958 --> 01:49:15,959
- Life support?
- Go.

1607
01:49:16,335 --> 01:49:17,711
We are go for closure.

1608
01:49:20,130 --> 01:49:21,757
I'm go here.

1609
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:26,345
Mechanical, initiate
IPV closure sequence.

1610
01:49:28,013 --> 01:49:29,680
Let me get you a chair.

1611
01:49:32,140 --> 01:49:34,786
- It's nice to smell
you again, Mr. Kitz.

1612
01:49:34,787 --> 01:49:35,477
- You too.

1613
01:49:36,228 --> 01:49:38,063
Wouldn't peg him as a Polo man.

1614
01:49:47,405 --> 01:49:48,904
I got a visual on the door.

1615
01:49:51,324 --> 01:49:53,160
The door is looking good.

1616
01:49:58,414 --> 01:50:00,083
Door alignment looks good.

1617
01:50:29,276 --> 01:50:30,778
We're green across the board.

1618
01:50:31,070 --> 01:50:33,572
Copy that, Control.
IPV is secure.

1619
01:50:41,411 --> 01:50:43,081
We are at 30%.

1620
01:50:43,581 --> 01:50:44,874
Copy that, 30%.

1621
01:50:49,710 --> 01:50:51,213
How you doing in there?

1622
01:50:51,672 --> 01:50:52,423
Kent?

1623
01:50:53,298 --> 01:50:54,049
Is that you?

1624
01:50:54,466 --> 01:50:56,050
That's a big affirmative.

1625
01:50:56,884 --> 01:50:58,429
Who let you in there?

1626
01:50:58,761 --> 01:51:00,764
A higher power intervened.

1627
01:51:02,808 --> 01:51:04,224
I'm glad you came.

1628
01:51:08,854 --> 01:51:10,105
35%.

1629
01:51:10,814 --> 01:51:12,191
Copy that, 35%.

1630
01:51:12,481 --> 01:51:13,900
- Mechanical?
- We're good.

1631
01:51:14,109 --> 01:51:15,484
40%.

1632
01:51:18,946 --> 01:51:20,906
I'm picking up a
moderate vibration.

1633
01:51:22,157 --> 01:51:24,159
Dynamics, can you
confirm vibration?

1634
01:51:24,368 --> 01:51:25,620
It looks good here.

1635
01:51:25,828 --> 01:51:28,996
She's feeling the same
thing they felt at the Cape.

1636
01:51:29,205 --> 01:51:30,290
Vibration's normal.

1637
01:51:30,999 --> 01:51:33,418
We are at 50%. All
systems nominal.

1638
01:51:33,668 --> 01:51:35,503
Copy that, 50%.

1639
01:51:40,967 --> 01:51:42,842
Vibration's a
little stronger now.

1640
01:51:43,176 --> 01:51:45,512
We're picking up some
low frequency noise.

1641
01:51:46,346 --> 01:51:47,805
Mechanical, confirm?

1642
01:51:48,013 --> 01:51:49,475
It looks fine to me.

1643
01:51:49,684 --> 01:51:51,810
Roger. Jerry,
what do you think?

1644
01:51:52,018 --> 01:51:52,854
I'm still go.

1645
01:51:53,144 --> 01:51:54,646
People, we are still go.

1646
01:51:57,482 --> 01:51:58,984
Something's happening.

1647
01:52:03,028 --> 01:52:04,529
You see that light?

1648
01:52:04,696 --> 01:52:05,823
I'm seeing...

1649
01:52:09,075 --> 01:52:11,036
I can't tell if it's daylight.

1650
01:52:11,911 --> 01:52:14,372
There it is again. It's
coming from the bottom.

1651
01:52:15,832 --> 01:52:17,416
Let me show you. See that?

1652
01:52:17,666 --> 01:52:19,835
Negative. You're breaking up.

1653
01:52:20,209 --> 01:52:22,338
- Can we boost signal?
- It's at maximum.

1654
01:52:22,838 --> 01:52:24,131
65%.

1655
01:52:24,340 --> 01:52:26,007
The material is changing.

1656
01:52:26,216 --> 01:52:29,676
It's bordering on translucence.
The system's intact.

1657
01:52:33,013 --> 01:52:34,556
It has to be...

1658
01:52:34,766 --> 01:52:37,309
...some kind of
electromagnetic field.

1659
01:52:37,558 --> 01:52:38,603
Do you read this?

1660
01:52:38,853 --> 01:52:40,855
We see only interference.

1661
01:52:40,897 --> 01:52:42,396
It's becoming translucent.

1662
01:52:43,272 --> 01:52:45,775
I can't describe it. I
can't even explain it!

1663
01:52:48,569 --> 01:52:49,528
70%.

1664
01:52:49,736 --> 01:52:52,073
We have intermittent
comm, but we are go!

1665
01:52:52,407 --> 01:52:54,408
Initiate secondary
drive systems.

1666
01:52:54,616 --> 01:52:56,702
Initiating auxiliary
booster sequence.

1667
01:52:56,910 --> 01:52:58,453
We're go for ignition.

1668
01:53:05,794 --> 01:53:07,378
We have auxiliary ignition.

1669
01:53:13,926 --> 01:53:15,428
Life support, how is she?

1670
01:53:15,595 --> 01:53:18,472
Heart and respiration are
high but within limits.

1671
01:53:18,764 --> 01:53:20,098
Ellie, do you copy?

1672
01:53:20,349 --> 01:53:21,309
If you hear...

1673
01:53:21,433 --> 01:53:23,353
...I am okay to go.

1674
01:53:32,026 --> 01:53:33,277
80%.

1675
01:53:33,527 --> 01:53:36,363
All vibration and
G-levels are in the green.

1676
01:53:41,826 --> 01:53:43,995
Control, if you're
reading me...

1677
01:53:44,287 --> 01:53:46,498
...I am okay to go! Okay to go!

1678
01:53:46,832 --> 01:53:47,791
85%.

1679
01:53:47,957 --> 01:53:49,375
All tips are on the profile.

1680
01:53:51,627 --> 01:53:54,630
90%. We're detecting some
structural instability.

1681
01:53:55,755 --> 01:53:58,633
- Is she holding?
- We're within limits, barely.

1682
01:54:00,135 --> 01:54:02,096
I'm okay to go!

1683
01:54:04,097 --> 01:54:05,764
I'm okay to go!

1684
01:54:12,021 --> 01:54:13,480
My God!

1685
01:54:24,488 --> 01:54:25,908
Okay to go!

1686
01:54:26,073 --> 01:54:27,118
I'm okay!

1687
01:54:27,410 --> 01:54:28,912
100% target velocity.

1688
01:54:30,454 --> 01:54:32,743
Tremendous EMI
levels around Machine!

1689
01:54:32,744 --> 01:54:34,791
Field measurements
are off-scale.

1690
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,337
We're approaching
our abort limits.

1691
01:54:39,838 --> 01:54:40,964
Okay to go.

1692
01:54:46,136 --> 01:54:46,970
I hear her!

1693
01:54:47,512 --> 01:54:50,429
I hear her. Barely,
but she's there.

1694
01:54:50,681 --> 01:54:51,847
Okay to go.

1695
01:54:52,226 --> 01:54:53,601
Says she's okay to go.

1696
01:54:56,646 --> 01:54:58,480
Steve, we're real close.

1697
01:54:58,812 --> 01:54:59,848
- Your core reading?

1698
01:54:59,849 --> 01:55:01,816
- Internal environment
looks normal.

1699
01:55:02,192 --> 01:55:04,903
Inside the core, the
weather's beautiful.

1700
01:55:08,990 --> 01:55:10,282
I'm okay to go.

1701
01:55:12,785 --> 01:55:14,245
I'm okay to go.

1702
01:55:14,786 --> 01:55:16,120
Initiate drop sequence.

1703
01:55:19,707 --> 01:55:21,459
On my mark.

1704
01:55:22,084 --> 01:55:23,085
10...

1705
01:55:23,628 --> 01:55:24,671
...9...

1706
01:55:25,672 --> 01:55:26,672
...8...

1707
01:55:28,214 --> 01:55:29,217
...7...

1708
01:55:29,591 --> 01:55:30,592
...6...

1709
01:55:31,217 --> 01:55:32,217
...5...

1710
01:55:32,510 --> 01:55:33,510
...4...

1711
01:55:34,055 --> 01:55:34,638
...3...

1712
01:55:35,597 --> 01:55:36,556
...2...

1713
01:55:36,764 --> 01:55:37,848
I'm okay to go.

1714
01:55:42,145 --> 01:55:43,813
Oh, God!

1715
01:55:53,362 --> 01:55:54,991
Ellie to Control.

1716
01:55:55,740 --> 01:55:58,201
Ellie to Control,
do you read me!

1717
01:56:02,871 --> 01:56:05,207
Ellie to Control,
do you read me!

1718
01:56:11,422 --> 01:56:12,548
I'll try...

1719
01:56:13,339 --> 01:56:14,800
...to keep recording!

1720
01:56:15,594 --> 01:56:17,218
I'm going through...

1721
01:56:17,427 --> 01:56:19,429
...some kind of a tunnel!

1722
01:56:34,859 --> 01:56:36,402
There's a light source ahead!

1723
01:56:37,028 --> 01:56:38,111
Brilliant...

1724
01:56:38,321 --> 01:56:39,696
...blue-white.

1725
01:56:41,366 --> 01:56:42,951
Residual radiation?

1726
01:56:54,668 --> 01:56:55,961
It's a star.

1727
01:56:56,546 --> 01:56:57,672
I must have...

1728
01:56:58,464 --> 01:56:59,965
...gone through a wormhole.

1729
01:57:05,136 --> 01:57:06,472
It's Vega!

1730
01:57:17,648 --> 01:57:19,400
I'm in another wormhole now!

1731
01:57:23,071 --> 01:57:24,155
I had no idea!

1732
01:57:24,404 --> 01:57:25,989
A series of them!

1733
01:57:28,951 --> 01:57:30,077
They're alive.

1734
01:57:30,368 --> 01:57:31,496
It's like...

1735
01:57:31,913 --> 01:57:34,330
...some kind of
a transit system.

1736
01:57:35,332 --> 01:57:36,706
A subway!

1737
01:57:36,874 --> 01:57:38,250
Oh, God!

1738
01:57:44,005 --> 01:57:45,924
I have to keep talking.

1739
01:57:49,010 --> 01:57:50,302
It's a triple...

1740
01:57:50,513 --> 01:57:52,764
...no, a quadruple system.

1741
01:57:53,305 --> 01:57:54,390
Beautiful!

1742
01:57:57,726 --> 01:57:58,979
They're alive!

1743
01:58:07,278 --> 01:58:08,987
Another wormhole!

1744
01:58:09,319 --> 01:58:11,114
This one's much more violent!

1745
01:59:44,741 --> 01:59:45,742
Some...

1746
01:59:47,159 --> 01:59:48,826
...celestial event...

1747
01:59:50,286 --> 01:59:51,287
No!

1748
01:59:52,163 --> 01:59:53,791
No words!

1749
01:59:54,167 --> 01:59:55,833
No words...

1750
01:59:57,502 --> 01:59:59,171
...to describe it!

1751
02:00:01,298 --> 02:00:02,800
Poetry!

1752
02:00:04,300 --> 02:00:05,843
They should have sent...

1753
02:00:06,512 --> 02:00:07,679
...a poet.

1754
02:00:08,178 --> 02:00:09,682
It's so beautiful!

1755
02:00:10,974 --> 02:00:12,182
Beautiful!

1756
02:00:14,019 --> 02:00:15,853
So beautiful.

1757
02:00:20,356 --> 02:00:22,859
I had no idea.

1758
02:03:02,379 --> 02:03:03,672
Hi, Sparks.

1759
02:03:05,550 --> 02:03:06,551
Dad?

1760
02:03:14,516 --> 02:03:16,184
I missed you.

1761
02:03:22,190 --> 02:03:23,190
Aren't you...?

1762
02:03:23,356 --> 02:03:26,192
I'm sorry I couldn't be
there for you, sweetheart.

1763
02:03:36,368 --> 02:03:37,744
You're not real.

1764
02:03:39,747 --> 02:03:41,207
None of this is real!

1765
02:03:41,415 --> 02:03:43,166
That's my scientist.

1766
02:03:44,542 --> 02:03:46,325
When I was unconscious, you

1767
02:03:46,326 --> 02:03:48,838
downloaded my
thoughts, my memories.

1768
02:03:49,839 --> 02:03:51,216
Pensacola!

1769
02:03:54,425 --> 02:03:56,887
We thought it might make
things easier for you.

1770
02:04:10,733 --> 02:04:12,151
Why did you contact us?

1771
02:04:12,361 --> 02:04:14,071
You contacted us.

1772
02:04:14,571 --> 02:04:16,198
We were just listening.

1773
02:04:17,031 --> 02:04:18,365
There are others?

1774
02:04:18,657 --> 02:04:19,825
Many others.

1775
02:04:24,955 --> 02:04:26,206
They all...

1776
02:04:26,664 --> 02:04:29,793
...travel here through that
transit system you built?

1777
02:04:30,334 --> 02:04:31,794
We didn't build it.

1778
02:04:32,962 --> 02:04:34,505
We don't know who did.

1779
02:04:36,591 --> 02:04:39,259
They were gone long
before we ever got here.

1780
02:04:40,177 --> 02:04:42,012
Maybe someday
they'll come back.

1781
02:04:43,012 --> 02:04:45,514
All the civilizations
you find come here?

1782
02:04:45,724 --> 02:04:47,016
Not all.

1783
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:51,937
- Is this some test?
- No, no test.

1784
02:04:54,857 --> 02:04:56,400
You have your mother's hands.

1785
02:05:06,616 --> 02:05:08,785
You're an
interesting species...

1786
02:05:09,452 --> 02:05:11,080
...an interesting mix.

1787
02:05:12,373 --> 02:05:15,125
You're capable of such
beautiful dreams...

1788
02:05:16,168 --> 02:05:18,293
...and such
horrible nightmares.

1789
02:05:19,754 --> 02:05:21,589
You feel so lost...

1790
02:05:22,381 --> 02:05:24,884
...so cut off, so alone.

1791
02:05:26,593 --> 02:05:27,971
Only you're not.

1792
02:05:32,433 --> 02:05:34,100
In all our searching...

1793
02:05:34,311 --> 02:05:37,229
...all we've found that makes
the emptiness bearable...

1794
02:05:37,979 --> 02:05:39,355
...is each other.

1795
02:05:43,318 --> 02:05:44,986
What happens now?

1796
02:05:46,278 --> 02:05:47,405
Now?

1797
02:05:48,740 --> 02:05:50,240
You go home.

1798
02:05:50,741 --> 02:05:51,826
Home?

1799
02:05:52,326 --> 02:05:53,410
But...

1800
02:05:53,911 --> 02:05:55,371
...I have so many questions.

1801
02:05:55,746 --> 02:05:57,414
Do we get to come back?

1802
02:05:58,538 --> 02:06:00,376
This was just a first step.

1803
02:06:00,918 --> 02:06:02,710
In time, you'll take another.

1804
02:06:04,295 --> 02:06:06,838
But other people need
to see what I've seen...

1805
02:06:07,047 --> 02:06:10,051
This is the way it's been
done for billions of years.

1806
02:06:12,427 --> 02:06:14,096
Small moves, Ellie.

1807
02:06:15,930 --> 02:06:17,599
Small moves.

1808
02:07:01,138 --> 02:07:02,765
We've got video on Ellie!

1809
02:07:02,974 --> 02:07:04,934
She's through!
She is in the net.

1810
02:07:05,142 --> 02:07:07,561
She's alive. Get the
President on the phone!

1811
02:07:08,354 --> 02:07:09,855
What's going on? How is she?

1812
02:07:10,730 --> 02:07:12,440
Ellie, this is
Control. You copy?

1813
02:07:12,649 --> 02:07:14,109
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1814
02:07:14,817 --> 02:07:16,444
- She's alive.
- Put her on P.A.

1815
02:07:16,653 --> 02:07:18,237
Ellie, hold on tight.

1816
02:07:18,822 --> 02:07:20,412
We're still trying to determine

1817
02:07:20,413 --> 02:07:22,157
the nature of
the malfunction...

1818
02:07:22,408 --> 02:07:24,910
...but the important
thing is you're okay.

1819
02:07:25,162 --> 02:07:26,163
What?

1820
02:07:26,494 --> 02:07:27,955
It's all right.

1821
02:07:28,165 --> 02:07:30,081
The important thing
is you're safe.

1822
02:07:31,082 --> 02:07:32,835
What malfunction?

1823
02:07:37,297 --> 02:07:38,630
What happened?

1824
02:07:40,256 --> 02:07:41,759
What day is this?

1825
02:07:42,594 --> 02:07:43,552
I'm sorry.

1826
02:07:43,761 --> 02:07:45,261
Did you say what day?

1827
02:07:46,847 --> 02:07:48,431
How long was I gone?

1828
02:07:50,683 --> 02:07:54,854
The IPV dropped straight
through the Machine.

1829
02:07:55,771 --> 02:07:57,522
You didn't go anywhere.

1830
02:07:58,274 --> 02:07:59,608
But I did.

1831
02:07:59,858 --> 02:08:01,193
I did go.

1832
02:08:01,693 --> 02:08:03,862
That's what I've
tried to tell everyone.

1833
02:08:08,534 --> 02:08:11,118
But the headset didn't
record a single image?

1834
02:08:11,786 --> 02:08:13,122
Just this.

1835
02:08:13,370 --> 02:08:14,413
Static.

1836
02:08:14,623 --> 02:08:15,624
Thank you.

1837
02:08:17,042 --> 02:08:18,792
Let me show you what we saw.

1838
02:08:28,802 --> 02:08:32,472
43 separate remote cameras
show exactly the same event.

1839
02:08:32,723 --> 02:08:34,171
The IPV dropped straight

1840
02:08:34,172 --> 02:08:36,225
through. Everyone
saw exactly...

1841
02:08:36,559 --> 02:08:37,894
...the same thing.

1842
02:08:38,310 --> 02:08:39,729
Nothing happened.

1843
02:08:41,396 --> 02:08:43,399
How do you explain
this, Doctor?

1844
02:08:45,650 --> 02:08:46,775
I can't.

1845
02:08:47,026 --> 02:08:48,487
I'd encourage you...

1846
02:08:50,239 --> 02:08:52,449
...not to inflame
this situation...

1847
02:08:52,657 --> 02:08:54,450
...beyond the facts.

1848
02:08:54,658 --> 02:08:57,870
Let us deal with
this on the facts.

1849
02:08:58,161 --> 02:09:01,082
We are monitoring what
has actually happened.

1850
02:09:01,331 --> 02:09:04,376
We are taking what we
believe are factually...

1851
02:09:04,627 --> 02:09:06,628
...appropriate steps.

1852
02:09:06,878 --> 02:09:09,923
Amid a flurry of accusations
and counter-accusations...

1853
02:09:10,131 --> 02:09:12,758
...by the nations representing
the Machine Consortium...

1854
02:09:12,968 --> 02:09:15,802
...the President has
ordered a special inquiry.

1855
02:09:16,011 --> 02:09:18,806
But the appointment to the
committee of Michael Kitz...

1856
02:09:19,013 --> 02:09:21,851
...who has resigned as
National Security Advisor...

1857
02:09:22,058 --> 02:09:24,519
...has raised eyebrows
on Capitol Hill.

1858
02:09:24,726 --> 02:09:26,568
I have made no
decision to run for

1859
02:09:26,569 --> 02:09:28,355
Congress, announced
no candidacy.

1860
02:09:28,604 --> 02:09:31,944
I resigned as National
Security Advisor...

1861
02:09:32,111 --> 02:09:36,280
...in order to devote all
of my energy to this inquiry.

1862
02:09:37,029 --> 02:09:39,141
The people of the world have a

1863
02:09:39,142 --> 02:09:41,743
right to know what
really happened.

1864
02:09:42,536 --> 02:09:45,163
Yet every scientific
instrument confirms...

1865
02:09:45,371 --> 02:09:47,215
...the IPV was out of contact

1866
02:09:47,216 --> 02:09:49,375
for only a fraction
of a second.

1867
02:09:49,585 --> 02:09:51,376
Isn't that correct, Doctor?

1868
02:09:53,296 --> 02:09:55,631
A fraction of a
second Earth time, yes.

1869
02:09:56,506 --> 02:09:57,799
Earth time?

1870
02:09:58,050 --> 02:10:01,553
Senator, I believe that the
Machine opened up a wormhole...

1871
02:10:01,886 --> 02:10:04,254
...a tunnel through
space-time, also

1872
02:10:04,255 --> 02:10:06,557
known as an
Einstein-Rossen Bridge.

1873
02:10:06,809 --> 02:10:09,110
Due to the effect of
general relativity,

1874
02:10:09,111 --> 02:10:11,021
what I experienced
as 18 hours...

1875
02:10:11,269 --> 02:10:13,481
...passed
instantaneously on Earth.

1876
02:10:13,731 --> 02:10:15,815
Isn't it true
these wormholes are

1877
02:10:15,816 --> 02:10:17,775
merely theoretical predictions?

1878
02:10:18,151 --> 02:10:20,821
There is no evidence
they actually exist?

1879
02:10:21,029 --> 02:10:22,780
There is no direct
evidence, no.

1880
02:10:22,990 --> 02:10:24,156
Tell me...

1881
02:10:24,698 --> 02:10:27,660
...why would these aliens
go to all this trouble?

1882
02:10:28,161 --> 02:10:30,262
Bring you thousands
of light years,

1883
02:10:30,263 --> 02:10:32,247
then send you
home without proof?

1884
02:10:32,915 --> 02:10:35,710
They said it's how it's been
done for billions of years.

1885
02:10:36,169 --> 02:10:39,546
You have no proof because they
didn't want you to have any.

1886
02:10:39,837 --> 02:10:42,002
A phenomenon known
in psychiatric

1887
02:10:42,003 --> 02:10:44,550
circles as a
self-reinforcing delusion.

1888
02:10:45,218 --> 02:10:46,676
You think I was delusional?

1889
02:10:46,886 --> 02:10:48,880
I do think you
may have suffered

1890
02:10:48,881 --> 02:10:51,056
some kind of an
episode. Yes, I do.

1891
02:10:51,307 --> 02:10:54,101
I'd like to propose an
alternate hypothesis...

1892
02:10:54,310 --> 02:10:56,092
...and I'd like
you to bring your

1893
02:10:56,093 --> 02:10:57,980
scientific expertise
to bear on it.

1894
02:10:58,229 --> 02:11:01,192
To fake a signal from Vega...

1895
02:11:02,026 --> 02:11:03,318
...what would you need?

1896
02:11:05,278 --> 02:11:07,081
You'd need a
satellite to transmit

1897
02:11:07,082 --> 02:11:08,988
it, but it would
be impossible to...

1898
02:11:09,199 --> 02:11:10,915
You'd need a satellite and

1899
02:11:10,916 --> 02:11:13,160
launch capabilities
to orbit it.

1900
02:11:13,369 --> 02:11:16,705
And the message itself. To put
something like this together...

1901
02:11:16,831 --> 02:11:19,165
...so complex, drawing
on many disciplines...

1902
02:11:19,375 --> 02:11:20,708
Would be impossible.

1903
02:11:22,544 --> 02:11:24,002
Impossible?

1904
02:11:24,546 --> 02:11:27,507
Is there anyone who might
have been up to the challenge?

1905
02:11:28,382 --> 02:11:30,843
Someone with extraordinary
technical expertise...

1906
02:11:31,176 --> 02:11:33,177
...enormous
financial resources...

1907
02:11:33,594 --> 02:11:35,783
...someone perverse
enough, eccentric

1908
02:11:35,784 --> 02:11:37,683
enough to come
up with the idea?

1909
02:11:39,392 --> 02:11:40,184
Hadden?

1910
02:11:41,269 --> 02:11:43,229
S. R. Hadden.

1911
02:11:47,859 --> 02:11:49,483
You're implying
that this was...

1912
02:11:49,734 --> 02:11:52,196
...some kind of a hoax?
That he engineered this?

1913
02:11:52,404 --> 02:11:53,779
S. R. Hadden...

1914
02:11:54,072 --> 02:11:56,055
...a legendary power broker in

1915
02:11:56,056 --> 02:11:58,700
perhaps his final
bid for immortality.

1916
02:11:58,909 --> 02:12:01,662
Maybe he wanted to
exploit new technologies...

1917
02:12:01,829 --> 02:12:03,955
...having world
governments pick up the tab.

1918
02:12:04,164 --> 02:12:06,917
Perhaps this was his
final altruistic gesture...

1919
02:12:07,208 --> 02:12:08,780
...to unite the world in some

1920
02:12:08,781 --> 02:12:10,837
common goal. Maybe
all of the above.

1921
02:12:11,212 --> 02:12:13,382
S. R. Hadden, a brilliant...

1922
02:12:13,924 --> 02:12:15,675
...and complicated man.

1923
02:12:18,511 --> 02:12:22,307
Doctor, are you familiar
with the scientific precept...

1924
02:12:22,974 --> 02:12:25,143
...known as Occam's Razor?

1925
02:12:31,273 --> 02:12:32,440
Yes.

1926
02:12:34,442 --> 02:12:36,679
It means the
simplest explanation

1927
02:12:36,680 --> 02:12:39,113
generally tends to
be the right one.

1928
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:40,406
Exactly.

1929
02:12:41,074 --> 02:12:43,617
You tell me. What
is more likely here?

1930
02:12:43,825 --> 02:12:47,121
A message from aliens results
in a magical machine...

1931
02:12:47,330 --> 02:12:50,041
...that whisks you to the
center of the galaxy...

1932
02:12:50,291 --> 02:12:53,126
...to windsurf with Dad
and a split second later...

1933
02:12:53,293 --> 02:12:56,796
...returns you home without
a single shred of proof?

1934
02:12:57,253 --> 02:13:00,674
Or that your experience
is the result of being...

1935
02:13:00,926 --> 02:13:04,303
...the unwitting star in the
farewell performance of one...

1936
02:13:04,470 --> 02:13:05,429
...S.R. Hadden?

1937
02:13:05,637 --> 02:13:09,350
A man with the means and motive
to play you and all of us...

1938
02:13:09,557 --> 02:13:11,811
...as pawns in
the most elaborate,

1939
02:13:11,812 --> 02:13:13,936
most expensive
hoax of all time?

1940
02:13:18,900 --> 02:13:22,568
You come to us with no
evidence, no records...

1941
02:13:23,277 --> 02:13:25,030
...no artifacts...

1942
02:13:25,446 --> 02:13:29,574
...only a story that, to put
it mildly, strains credibility.

1943
02:13:30,867 --> 02:13:33,831
Over half a trillion
dollars were spent.

1944
02:13:34,164 --> 02:13:36,667
Dozens of lives were lost.

1945
02:13:37,750 --> 02:13:39,971
Are you going to
sit there and tell

1946
02:13:39,971 --> 02:13:42,130
us we should just
take this all...

1947
02:13:43,173 --> 02:13:44,631
...on faith?

1948
02:13:48,635 --> 02:13:50,636
Please answer the
question, Doctor.

1949
02:13:54,766 --> 02:13:56,977
Is it possible that
it didn't happen?

1950
02:13:57,185 --> 02:13:58,269
Yes.

1951
02:14:01,104 --> 02:14:04,231
As a scientist I must concede
that. I must volunteer that.

1952
02:14:08,779 --> 02:14:10,072
Let me get this straight.

1953
02:14:10,530 --> 02:14:14,492
You admit you have no physical
evidence to back up your story?

1954
02:14:14,992 --> 02:14:15,910
Yes.

1955
02:14:16,118 --> 02:14:19,163
You admit you may have
hallucinated this whole thing?

1956
02:14:19,913 --> 02:14:22,250
You admit if you were
in our position...

1957
02:14:22,458 --> 02:14:26,002
...you would be as incredulous
and skeptical as we?

1958
02:14:27,546 --> 02:14:29,679
Then why don't
you simply withdraw

1959
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:31,507
your testimony and concede...

1960
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:33,934
...that this
journey to the center

1961
02:14:33,935 --> 02:14:35,886
of the galaxy never took place?

1962
02:14:38,889 --> 02:14:40,724
Because I can't.

1963
02:14:47,646 --> 02:14:50,316
I had an experience.

1964
02:14:52,735 --> 02:14:55,363
I can't prove it. I
can't even explain it.

1965
02:14:55,572 --> 02:14:58,532
But everything I know as a
human being, everything I am...

1966
02:14:58,741 --> 02:15:00,868
...tells me it was real.

1967
02:15:03,288 --> 02:15:04,987
I was given
something wonderful,

1968
02:15:04,988 --> 02:15:06,791
something that
changed me forever.

1969
02:15:07,081 --> 02:15:08,081
A vision...

1970
02:15:08,750 --> 02:15:10,375
...of the universe...

1971
02:15:11,084 --> 02:15:13,253
...that tells us undeniably...

1972
02:15:13,756 --> 02:15:16,090
...how tiny and
insignificant...

1973
02:15:16,256 --> 02:15:19,886
...and how rare and
precious we all are.

1974
02:15:21,053 --> 02:15:24,098
A vision that tells us that
we belong to something...

1975
02:15:24,389 --> 02:15:27,025
...that is greater
than ourselves,

1976
02:15:27,026 --> 02:15:29,061
that none of us are alone.

1977
02:15:33,939 --> 02:15:36,942
I wish I could share that.

1978
02:15:40,445 --> 02:15:41,613
I wish...

1979
02:15:43,239 --> 02:15:45,741
...that everyone,
if even for one...

1980
02:15:46,076 --> 02:15:47,243
...moment...

1981
02:15:47,451 --> 02:15:48,786
...could feel...

1982
02:15:49,246 --> 02:15:52,248
...that awe and
humility and hope.

1983
02:16:01,632 --> 02:16:03,926
That continues to be my wish.

1984
02:16:45,171 --> 02:16:47,758
Dr. Arroway, can I
get a picture, please.

1985
02:17:29,795 --> 02:17:30,921
Reverend Joss!

1986
02:17:31,128 --> 02:17:32,755
What do you believe?!

1987
02:17:38,679 --> 02:17:40,680
As a person of
faith, I'm bound by a

1988
02:17:40,681 --> 02:17:42,682
different covenant
than Dr. Arroway.

1989
02:17:44,434 --> 02:17:46,685
But our goal is
one and the same.

1990
02:17:47,228 --> 02:17:48,854
The pursuit of truth.

1991
02:17:52,358 --> 02:17:53,691
I, for one, believe her.

1992
02:18:17,214 --> 02:18:20,132
So what happens now?
We give her a medal?

1993
02:18:20,550 --> 02:18:22,967
I'd say at least
a healthy grant.

1994
02:18:23,345 --> 02:18:25,028
You read the
confidential report

1995
02:18:25,029 --> 02:18:26,764
from the investigating
committee?

1996
02:18:26,971 --> 02:18:28,390
I flipped through it.

1997
02:18:28,890 --> 02:18:30,830
I was very interested in the

1998
02:18:30,831 --> 02:18:33,187
section on
Arroway's video unit.

1999
02:18:33,938 --> 02:18:36,231
The one that
recorded the static.

2000
02:18:37,480 --> 02:18:38,857
Continue.

2001
02:18:39,858 --> 02:18:43,237
The fact that it recorded
static isn't what interests me.

2002
02:18:48,492 --> 02:18:49,869
Continue.

2003
02:18:50,785 --> 02:18:52,619
What interests me...

2004
02:18:52,912 --> 02:18:56,622
...is that it recorded
approximately 18 hours of it.

2005
02:19:01,837 --> 02:19:03,757
That is interesting, isn't it?

2006
02:19:10,429 --> 02:19:12,510
And you can see
over there, we're

2007
02:19:12,511 --> 02:19:14,349
building 45 brand new dishes.

2008
02:19:14,641 --> 02:19:16,695
That means when you
put them together

2009
02:19:16,696 --> 02:19:18,478
with all the
radio telescopes...

2010
02:19:18,644 --> 02:19:20,146
...all over the world...

2011
02:19:20,313 --> 02:19:22,417
...we'll hear
farther into space

2012
02:19:22,418 --> 02:19:24,649
than anyone has
ever heard before.

2013
02:19:26,193 --> 02:19:29,153
Are there other people
out there in the universe?

2014
02:19:30,071 --> 02:19:31,490
That's a good question.

2015
02:19:31,740 --> 02:19:32,907
What do you think?

2016
02:19:33,533 --> 02:19:34,492
I don't know.

2017
02:19:34,992 --> 02:19:36,494
That's a good answer.

2018
02:19:37,829 --> 02:19:38,830
Skeptic, huh?

2019
02:19:40,039 --> 02:19:42,281
The important thing
is that you all

2020
02:19:42,282 --> 02:19:44,584
keep searching for
your own answers.

2021
02:19:45,085 --> 02:19:47,171
One thing about the
universe, though.

2022
02:19:48,088 --> 02:19:49,339
The universe...

2023
02:19:49,797 --> 02:19:51,965
...is a pretty big place.

2024
02:19:52,967 --> 02:19:55,345
It's bigger than anything...

2025
02:19:55,637 --> 02:19:58,472
...anyone has ever
dreamed of before.

2026
02:20:00,098 --> 02:20:01,725
So if it's just us...

2027
02:20:03,561 --> 02:20:05,771
...it seems like an
awful waste of space.

2028
02:20:07,688 --> 02:20:08,688
Right?
