2
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:02,905
Amazing. This is amazing!

3
00:03:03,244 --> 00:03:06,270
The entire work force of Virginia...

4
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:09,507
...had Solitaire removed
from their computers...

5
00:03:09,683 --> 00:03:11,981
...because they hadn't done
any work in six weeks.

6
00:03:12,153 --> 00:03:14,087
- That's so sad.
- Do you know what this is?

7
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:17,452
What we're seeing here is the end of
Western civilization as we know it.

8
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,923
Hey, aren't you late?

9
00:03:20,094 --> 00:03:23,928
Technology. Name me one thing
that we've gained from technology.

10
00:03:24,098 --> 00:03:25,429
Electricity.

11
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,126
That's one. You think this machine's
your friend, but it's not.

12
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,463
- I'm out of here.
- See you tonight.

13
00:03:31,705 --> 00:03:33,673
- Sushi!
- Sushi!

14
00:03:34,008 --> 00:03:35,202
Bye!

15
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:25,483
<i>Welcome.</i>

16
00:04:27,728 --> 00:04:29,696
<i>You've got mail.</i>

17
00:04:38,772 --> 00:04:41,764
"Brinkley is my dog. He loves the streets
of New York as much as I do."

18
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:44,604
<i>Although he likes to eat pizza
and bagel off the sidewalk...</i>

19
00:04:44,778 --> 00:04:46,541
<i>... and I prefer to buy them.</i>

20
00:04:46,947 --> 00:04:50,075
<i>Brinkley is a great catcher who was
offered a tryout on the Mets.</i>

21
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:53,548
<i>But he chose to stay with me
so he could spend 18 hours a day...</i>

22
00:04:53,721 --> 00:04:57,054
<i>... sleeping on a large green pillow
the size of an inner tube.</i>

23
00:04:57,424 --> 00:04:59,221
<i>Don't you love New York in the fall?</i>

24
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,951
<i>Makes me want to buy school supplies.</i>

25
00:05:02,396 --> 00:05:03,693
I'm almost ready.

26
00:05:03,864 --> 00:05:06,765
<i>I would send you a bouquet
of newly sharpened pencils...</i>

27
00:05:07,034 --> 00:05:09,400
<i>... if I knew your name and address.</i>

28
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,436
<i>On the other hand,
this not knowing has its charms.</i>

29
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:15,097
- Did you push it?
- Yeah.

30
00:05:15,276 --> 00:05:16,766
Yes, I pushed it.

31
00:05:17,244 --> 00:05:18,734
I'm so late.

32
00:05:20,414 --> 00:05:22,974
Random House fired Dick Atkins.
Good riddance.

33
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,185
Murray Chilton died. That's one
less person I'm not speaking to.

34
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,718
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

35
00:05:31,725 --> 00:05:34,694
Vince got a great review.
He'll be insufferable.

36
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:36,423
Tonight, PEN dinner.

37
00:05:37,731 --> 00:05:40,097
- Am I going?
- Joe Fox, you promised.

38
00:05:41,936 --> 00:05:42,960
It's black-tie.

39
00:05:43,737 --> 00:05:45,728
Can't I just give money instead?

40
00:05:45,973 --> 00:05:48,806
What is it this week?
"Free Albanian writers"?

41
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:50,135
I'm in favor of that.

42
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:56,442
Okay, I'll go. I'll go. You're late.

43
00:05:56,717 --> 00:05:58,309
I know, I know.

44
00:06:13,467 --> 00:06:15,230
Good morning, Miss Eden.

45
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:35,045
Who's a happy dog?
Who's a happy dog?

46
00:06:41,028 --> 00:06:42,359
<i>- - Welcome.
- Welcome.</i>

47
00:06:44,198 --> 00:06:45,893
<i>- You've got mail.
- You've got mail.</i>

48
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:48,500
All right. Okay.
Get down, get down.

49
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:54,735
<i>Dear friend:
I like to start my notes to you...</i>

50
00:06:54,908 --> 00:06:57,399
<i>... as if we're already
in the middle of a conversation.</i>

51
00:06:57,578 --> 00:07:00,046
<i>I pretend that we're the oldest
and dearest friends...</i>

52
00:07:00,214 --> 00:07:01,875
<i>... as opposed to what
we actually are:</i>

53
00:07:02,483 --> 00:07:04,713
<i>People who don't know
each other's names...</i>

54
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:08,011
<i>... and met in a chat room where we
both claimed we'd never been before.</i>

55
00:07:08,922 --> 00:07:12,688
<i>"What will NY152 say today?"
I wonder.</i>

56
00:07:13,594 --> 00:07:15,425
<i>I turn on my computer.</i>

57
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:18,358
<i>I wait impatiently as it connects.</i>

58
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:20,362
<i>I go online...</i>

59
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:25,197
<i>... and my breath catches in my chest
until I hear three little words:</i>

60
00:07:25,706 --> 00:07:27,731
<i>"You've got mail."</i>

61
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:32,042
<i>I hear nothing, not even a sound
on the streets of New York.</i>

62
00:07:32,312 --> 00:07:34,439
<i>Just the beat of my own heart.</i>

63
00:07:34,615 --> 00:07:36,378
<i>I have mail...</i>

64
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,847
<i>... from you.</i>

65
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:41,848
<i>The electrical contractor called,
his truck hit a deer last night.</i>

66
00:08:42,015 --> 00:08:43,983
So he's not gonna be here
till tomorrow.

67
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:46,085
And upstairs, the shelves are late...

68
00:08:46,253 --> 00:08:48,278
...because the pine
we ordered has beetles.

69
00:08:48,455 --> 00:08:49,752
Very good, very good.

70
00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:53,120
And we got a $50,000 ticket for
construction workers peeing off the roof.

71
00:08:53,293 --> 00:08:56,592
Great. That is great.
Is the electrician here?

72
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,823
I just told you he hit a deer.
I knew you weren't listening to me.

73
00:09:01,702 --> 00:09:03,602
You're right. I wasn't.

74
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,533
"I hear nothing.

75
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:09,164
Not a sound on the city streets,
just the beat of my own heart."

76
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:12,207
I think that's how it goes.
Something like that.

77
00:09:12,646 --> 00:09:15,706
You and Patricia got engaged,
didn't you? You can tell me.

78
00:09:15,983 --> 00:09:17,211
- Engaged?
- Come on.

79
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:18,441
Are you crazy?

80
00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:20,314
I thought you liked Patricia.

81
00:09:20,487 --> 00:09:23,718
I do. I do. I love Patricia.
I love Patricia.

82
00:09:23,957 --> 00:09:28,053
Patricia is... Patricia's amazing.
She makes coffee nervous.

83
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:30,526
We should announce ourselves
to the neighborhood.

84
00:09:30,697 --> 00:09:32,028
Let them know, here we come.

85
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:33,894
This is the Upper West Side.

86
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:36,399
We might as well tell them
we're opening a crack house.

87
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,832
They're going to hate us.

88
00:09:38,005 --> 00:09:39,495
They're gonna be lining up...

89
00:09:39,673 --> 00:09:41,800
To picket the big, bad chain store...

90
00:09:41,975 --> 00:09:43,135
That's out to destroy...

91
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,504
Everything they hold dear.

92
00:09:44,678 --> 00:09:48,205
We're going to seduce them
with our square footage...

93
00:09:48,382 --> 00:09:52,148
...and our discounts
and our deep armchairs...

94
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:54,219
And our cappuccino.

95
00:09:54,388 --> 00:09:56,879
They're going to hate us
at the beginning...

96
00:09:57,057 --> 00:09:58,888
But we'll get them in the end.

97
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:01,024
- And you know why?
- Why?

98
00:10:01,695 --> 00:10:04,960
Because we're gonna sell them cheap
books and legal addictive stimulants.

99
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:08,032
In the meantime,
we'll just put up a big sign:

100
00:10:08,268 --> 00:10:11,237
"Coming soon, a Fox Books Superstore.
The end of civilization...

101
00:10:11,405 --> 00:10:12,770
<i>... as you know it. "</i>

102
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,577
Good morning, Christina.

103
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:20,110
Morning, Kathleen.

104
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,875
It's a beautiful day.
Isn't it just the most beautiful day?

105
00:10:24,051 --> 00:10:26,042
I guess. Yeah, sure.

106
00:10:27,788 --> 00:10:30,780
- Idiot, what are you doing?
- I got the green light!

107
00:10:30,991 --> 00:10:33,186
Don't you just love
New York in the fall?

108
00:10:41,435 --> 00:10:42,629
Perfect.

109
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:52,101
Can't beat that.

110
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:55,009
Scotch tape?
What is going on with you?

111
00:10:55,415 --> 00:10:56,746
Nothing.

112
00:10:57,517 --> 00:11:00,077
- You're in love.
- In love? No.

113
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:05,390
Yes, that's right!
I'm in love with Frank.

114
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:09,084
I'm practically living with Frank.

115
00:11:09,263 --> 00:11:12,460
Do you think you could get our
Christmas mailers out this week?

116
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:17,161
Yeah, by Monday, I promise.
I have this paper due Friday.

117
00:11:19,606 --> 00:11:21,574
What is going on?

118
00:11:21,775 --> 00:11:23,743
Nothing, nothing. Nothing at all.

119
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,971
You know, I am just going to
stand here until you tell me.

120
00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:29,909
All right.

121
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:33,075
Is it infidelity if you're involved
with someone on e-mail?

122
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:34,845
Have you had sex?

123
00:11:35,055 --> 00:11:36,750
No, I don't even know him.

124
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:39,357
- I mean cybersex.
- No.

125
00:11:39,593 --> 00:11:44,360
Well, don't do it. The minute you do,
they lose all respect for you.

126
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:47,133
Well, it's not like that.

127
00:11:47,301 --> 00:11:48,996
We just e-mail.
It's really nothing.

128
00:11:49,169 --> 00:11:53,265
On top of which, I'm thinking of
stopping because it's getting...

129
00:11:53,507 --> 00:11:54,838
out of hand?

130
00:11:55,676 --> 00:11:57,166
Confusing.

131
00:11:57,477 --> 00:12:00,002
But not. Because it's nothing.

132
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,440
Where'd you meet him?

133
00:12:01,615 --> 00:12:03,674
Listen, I can't even remember.

134
00:12:09,656 --> 00:12:14,320
On my birthday, I wandered into
the "over 30" room for a joke, sort of.

135
00:12:14,628 --> 00:12:16,687
And he was there.
And we started chatting.

136
00:12:16,897 --> 00:12:18,455
About what?

137
00:12:19,032 --> 00:12:22,365
Books and music,
how much we both love New York...

138
00:12:22,602 --> 00:12:23,830
Harmless, harmless.

139
00:12:24,104 --> 00:12:25,401
Meaningless.

140
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,330
Bouquets of sharpened pencils.

141
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:29,899
Excuse me?

142
00:12:30,177 --> 00:12:31,201
Forget it.

143
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:34,973
We don't talk about anything personal,
so I don't know his name...

144
00:12:35,148 --> 00:12:37,309
...or what he does
or where he lives exactly...

145
00:12:37,484 --> 00:12:41,978
...so it'll be easy for me to stop
seeing him, because I'm not.

146
00:12:42,656 --> 00:12:45,853
He could be the next person
to walk into the store.

147
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:47,050
I know.

148
00:12:47,227 --> 00:12:48,251
He could be...

149
00:12:51,631 --> 00:12:53,064
...George.

150
00:12:55,502 --> 00:12:56,560
Morning.

151
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,838
Are you online?

152
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:01,006
As far as I'm concerned...

153
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:04,369
...the Internet is just another way
of being rejected by a woman.

154
00:13:07,447 --> 00:13:08,914
Good morning.

155
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:10,707
Good morning, Birdie.

156
00:13:12,219 --> 00:13:14,153
What are you girls talking about?

157
00:13:14,554 --> 00:13:15,782
Cybersex.

158
00:13:15,956 --> 00:13:19,221
I tried to have cybersex once,
but I kept getting a busy signal.

159
00:13:19,393 --> 00:13:20,417
I know.

160
00:13:20,594 --> 00:13:23,620
I was really depressed
one Saturday night about 9:00...

161
00:13:23,797 --> 00:13:25,697
Time to open up!

162
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,302
Jessica and Maya, how are you today?

163
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:34,769
- Want to say hi to Kathleen?
- Hi, Kathleen.

164
00:13:34,941 --> 00:13:36,806
Good morning, Shop Around the Corner.

165
00:13:36,977 --> 00:13:38,774
George speaking. May I help you?

166
00:13:40,947 --> 00:13:43,108
Construction's going well.
We should open on time.

167
00:13:43,283 --> 00:13:47,617
Although Kevin and I are concerned
about the neighborhood response.

168
00:13:47,888 --> 00:13:51,051
This fabric on the couch,
what is it? Does it have a name?

169
00:13:51,224 --> 00:13:53,124
Money.

170
00:13:53,293 --> 00:13:55,124
Its name is "Money."

171
00:13:55,328 --> 00:13:57,694
- Gillian selected it.
- Good guess.

172
00:13:57,898 --> 00:14:00,492
- Your father's getting married again.
- Really?

173
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,099
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

174
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:03,964
- Why?
- Who knows?

175
00:14:04,137 --> 00:14:05,934
- Love?
- Possible.

176
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:07,733
I think you're a damn fool.

177
00:14:07,908 --> 00:14:09,967
Pops, Matthew is 4 years old, okay?

178
00:14:10,243 --> 00:14:12,734
It'd be nice if his parents were married.

179
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:16,011
Listen, I have a
sad announcement to make.

180
00:14:16,817 --> 00:14:19,479
City Books, on 23rd Street?

181
00:14:19,753 --> 00:14:20,913
It's going under.

182
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,355
Another independent bites the dust.

183
00:14:28,528 --> 00:14:29,859
On to the next!

184
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,493
Going to buy out their entire
inventory of architecture...

185
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,464
...and New York history
for the new store.

186
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:37,432
How much, son?
How much you paying?

187
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:39,502
Whatever it costs,
it won't be as much...

188
00:14:39,673 --> 00:14:41,834
...as that uncomfortable
mohair episode there...

189
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:44,533
...which is now all over my suit.

190
00:14:44,811 --> 00:14:45,971
Here you go.

191
00:14:46,346 --> 00:14:47,370
Thanks.

192
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:51,643
We'll also have a section dedicated to
writers who've lived on the West Side.

193
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:53,445
As a sop to the neighborhood.

194
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,953
Perfect. Keep those West Side,
liberal nuts, pseudo-intellectual...

195
00:14:57,123 --> 00:14:59,387
Readers, Dad.
They're called readers.

196
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:01,993
Don't do that, son.
Don't romanticize them.

197
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:04,153
It'll keep them from jumping
down your throat.

198
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:05,662
What's the competition?

199
00:15:05,832 --> 00:15:09,495
One mystery store, Sleuth,
at 78th and Amsterdam...

200
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:12,137
...and a children's bookstore,
Shop Around the Corner.

201
00:15:12,372 --> 00:15:15,068
- It's been there forever.
- Cecilia's store.

202
00:15:15,775 --> 00:15:16,799
Who's that?

203
00:15:17,677 --> 00:15:19,201
Cecilia Kelly.

204
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:22,778
Lovely woman. I think we might
have had a date once.

205
00:15:23,183 --> 00:15:25,276
Or maybe we just exchanged letters.

206
00:15:26,553 --> 00:15:27,986
You wrote her letters?

207
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:31,283
Mail. It was called mail.

208
00:15:32,392 --> 00:15:34,223
- Stamps, envelopes...
- I've heard of it.

209
00:15:34,494 --> 00:15:37,224
Cecilia had beautiful penmanship.

210
00:15:37,497 --> 00:15:39,931
She was too young for me...

211
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:42,924
...but she was enchanting.

212
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,361
- Enchanting?
- Her daughter owns it now.

213
00:15:46,806 --> 00:15:48,205
Too bad for her.

214
00:15:51,811 --> 00:15:53,176
- Excuse me, Mr. Fox.
- Yeah.

215
00:15:53,346 --> 00:15:55,041
<i>My father is getting married again.</i>

216
00:15:55,315 --> 00:15:58,011
<i>For five years, he's been living
with a woman named Gillian...</i>

217
00:15:58,184 --> 00:16:00,277
<i>... who studied decorating
at Caesar's Palace.</i>

218
00:16:00,453 --> 00:16:01,715
Is it porcelain?

219
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:03,447
Rubber.

220
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:08,289
<i>Once I read a story about a
butterfly in the subway, and today...</i>

221
00:16:08,461 --> 00:16:09,894
<i>... I saw one.</i>

222
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,928
<i>It got on at 42nd
and off at 59th where...</i>

223
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:14,862
<i>... I assume it went
to Bloomingdale's...</i>

224
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:17,196
<i>... to buy a hat that will
turn out to be a mistake.</i>

225
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,565
<i>As almost all hats are.</i>

226
00:16:21,341 --> 00:16:22,365
<i>Listen to this:</i>

227
00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:25,238
<i>Every night a truck pulls up
to my neighborhood bagel place...</i>

228
00:16:25,445 --> 00:16:28,243
<i>... and pumps about a ton of flour
into underground tanks.</i>

229
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:32,349
<i>The air is filled with white dust
which never seems to land.</i>

230
00:16:32,586 --> 00:16:34,110
<i>Why is that?</i>

231
00:16:35,288 --> 00:16:40,055
<i>I've read
Pride and Prejudice about 200 times.</i>

232
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,721
<i>I get lost in the language.
Words like:</i>

233
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:44,056
<i>"Thither."</i>

234
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,095
<i>"Mischance."</i>

235
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:47,961
<i>"Felicity."</i>

236
00:16:48,668 --> 00:16:51,296
<i>I'm always in agony over whether
Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy...</i>

237
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:53,803
<i>... are really going to get together.</i>

238
00:16:54,074 --> 00:16:55,234
<i>Read it.</i>

239
00:16:55,475 --> 00:16:57,568
<i>I know you'll love it.</i>

240
00:16:59,012 --> 00:17:00,843
<i>The purpose of places
like Starbucks...</i>

241
00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:03,482
<i>... is for people with
no decision-making ability...</i>

242
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,379
<i>... to make six decisions
just to buy one cup of coffee.</i>

243
00:17:07,654 --> 00:17:09,645
<i>Short, tall, light, dark...</i>

244
00:17:09,923 --> 00:17:11,584
<i>...caf, decaf...</i>

245
00:17:11,825 --> 00:17:13,588
<i>... low-fat, nonfat...</i>

246
00:17:13,893 --> 00:17:15,292
<i>... et cetera.</i>

247
00:17:15,795 --> 00:17:17,456
Mocha frappuccino grande.

248
00:17:17,697 --> 00:17:20,188
<i>So people who don't know
what the hell they're doing...</i>

249
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,198
<i>... or who on earth they are
can, for only 2.95...</i>

250
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,529
<i>... get not just a cup of coffee...</i>

251
00:17:25,805 --> 00:17:28,933
<i>... but an absolutely
defining sense of self.</i>

252
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:30,508
Tall, skim, caramel macchiato.

253
00:17:30,677 --> 00:17:31,837
<i>Tall!</i>

254
00:17:32,012 --> 00:17:33,104
<i>Decaf!</i>

255
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,541
<i>Cappuccino!</i>

256
00:17:34,714 --> 00:17:36,409
Tall, decaf cappuccino.

257
00:17:58,071 --> 00:17:59,436
Bummer!

258
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:03,735
A Fox Books superstore.

259
00:18:04,144 --> 00:18:06,374
<i>Quel nightmare.</i>

260
00:18:06,646 --> 00:18:10,343
It has nothing to do with us.
It's big, impersonal...

261
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:13,680
...overstocked and full
of ignorant salespeople.

262
00:18:13,953 --> 00:18:15,580
But they discount.

263
00:18:15,855 --> 00:18:17,823
But they don't provide any service.

264
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:19,389
We do.

265
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:20,887
<i>So, really...</i>

266
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:22,753
...it's a good development.

267
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:26,055
You know how in the flower district
there are all those shops...

268
00:18:26,232 --> 00:18:28,496
...so you can find whatever you want?

269
00:18:29,202 --> 00:18:31,898
This is going to be the book district.

270
00:18:32,172 --> 00:18:33,662
If they don't have it, we do.

271
00:18:34,974 --> 00:18:36,236
And vice versa.

272
00:18:36,476 --> 00:18:37,534
Absolutely.

273
00:18:41,247 --> 00:18:43,477
When you are finished
with Fox Books...

274
00:18:43,717 --> 00:18:47,016
...The Shop Around the Corner
is gonna be responsible...

275
00:18:47,253 --> 00:18:51,417
...for reversing the entire course
of the Industrial Revolution.

276
00:18:51,691 --> 00:18:54,421
Well, now, that is so sweet.
Frank!

277
00:18:54,694 --> 00:18:57,356
Thank you. That is so sweet.

278
00:18:57,597 --> 00:18:59,428
- Although I...
- What?

279
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:01,257
Wait a minute.
What is that doing here?

280
00:19:01,434 --> 00:19:02,901
Oh, my gosh!

281
00:19:03,136 --> 00:19:04,603
This is amazing.

282
00:19:04,871 --> 00:19:06,031
Listen.

283
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:10,305
The Olympia Report Deluxe electric.

284
00:19:10,543 --> 00:19:11,601
Report.

285
00:19:11,911 --> 00:19:13,208
As in gunshot.

286
00:19:13,446 --> 00:19:16,006
- That sound is familiar.
- Listen to this.

287
00:19:17,016 --> 00:19:18,540
What, that whirring?

288
00:19:18,785 --> 00:19:21,015
The gentle, soothing lullaby...

289
00:19:21,254 --> 00:19:23,279
...of a piece of machinery so perfect...

290
00:19:23,456 --> 00:19:26,550
I know where
I've heard that before, Frank.

291
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:28,785
I needed a backup.

292
00:19:28,962 --> 00:19:30,953
Don't you have another one
at your apartment?

293
00:19:31,131 --> 00:19:33,099
- I might.
- That you wrote a column about?

294
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:34,323
Yes. Who cares?

295
00:19:35,335 --> 00:19:36,825
What were you gonna say?

296
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:38,401
- When?
- Before.

297
00:19:38,571 --> 00:19:40,630
- Nothing.
- Come on.

298
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:47,605
Well, I'm just wondering.
I'm wondering about my work. I'm just...

299
00:19:47,814 --> 00:19:51,807
What is it that I do, exactly?
All I really do is...

300
00:19:52,085 --> 00:19:53,643
All you really do...

301
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,979
...is this incredibly noble thing.

302
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:58,822
- I don't know. Really, I'm just...
- Kathleen!

303
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:01,856
You are a lone reed.

304
00:20:03,963 --> 00:20:05,430
You are a lone...

305
00:20:07,267 --> 00:20:08,495
...reed...

306
00:20:08,668 --> 00:20:10,260
...standing...

307
00:20:10,436 --> 00:20:11,767
...tall...

308
00:20:12,005 --> 00:20:13,996
...waving boldly...

309
00:20:14,574 --> 00:20:16,667
...in the corrupt sands...

310
00:20:16,943 --> 00:20:18,342
...of commerce.

311
00:20:21,714 --> 00:20:24,080
- I am a lone reed.
- Lone reed.

312
00:20:25,285 --> 00:20:28,118
I am a lone reed.

313
00:20:34,227 --> 00:20:36,991
<i>Sometimes I wonder about my life.</i>

314
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,959
<i>I lead a small life.</i>

315
00:20:39,132 --> 00:20:41,726
<i>Well, valuable, but small.</i>

316
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:43,798
<i>And sometimes I wonder...</i>

317
00:20:44,003 --> 00:20:46,028
<i>... do I do it because I like it...</i>

318
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:48,639
<i>... or because I haven't been brave?</i>

319
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:52,978
<i>So much of what I see reminds me
of something I read in a book...</i>

320
00:20:53,146 --> 00:20:55,376
<i>... when shouldn't it be
the other way around?</i>

321
00:20:56,482 --> 00:20:58,712
<i>I don't want an answer.
I just want...</i>

322
00:20:58,918 --> 00:21:01,819
<i>... to send this cosmic question
out into the void.</i>

323
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:03,654
<i>So...</i>

324
00:21:03,857 --> 00:21:05,984
<i>... good night, dear void.</i>

325
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:14,560
- Hey, Joe!
- Hello, Joe.

326
00:21:15,001 --> 00:21:17,196
Hey! I know you!

327
00:21:19,172 --> 00:21:22,073
I know you.
Hello, Annabel, little girl.

328
00:21:22,242 --> 00:21:23,709
- Hi.
- How are you?

329
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,104
And you!

330
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:27,109
- Matthew, how are you?
- Good.

331
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,406
Good.

332
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:30,173
Ready to say hello to New Jersey?

333
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,419
Hello, New Jersey!

334
00:21:34,954 --> 00:21:36,751
Don't I get a hello?

335
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,648
Hello, Gillian.

336
00:21:39,525 --> 00:21:42,085
Kiss me. I'm gonna be
your wicked stepmother.

337
00:21:45,398 --> 00:21:46,422
There you go.

338
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,157
Hello. And who is this?

339
00:21:49,068 --> 00:21:51,969
Nanny Maureen. I brought her in
case you couldn't handle the kids.

340
00:21:52,605 --> 00:21:54,197
Maureen's getting a divorce.

341
00:21:54,474 --> 00:21:56,704
I'm sorry to hear that.

342
00:21:57,377 --> 00:22:00,710
It's my own fault.
Never marry a man who lies.

343
00:22:02,282 --> 00:22:05,217
That is so wise.
Annabel, remember that.

344
00:22:05,385 --> 00:22:07,148
She taught Matt to spell his name.

345
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,548
Really?

346
00:22:08,721 --> 00:22:10,211
- Let's hear it.
- F-O-X.

347
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,618
Excellent!

348
00:22:12,058 --> 00:22:15,255
Excellent. I've got this covered.
You can have the day off.

349
00:22:15,461 --> 00:22:19,124
And you must be late for something.
Volunteering, rolling bandages...

350
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:20,823
...for Bosnian refugees.

351
00:22:21,067 --> 00:22:24,127
I am. I'm having
my eggs harvested.

352
00:22:25,805 --> 00:22:28,774
And getting those eggs harvested.
Don't worry! See you later.

353
00:22:28,942 --> 00:22:30,409
- Bye, Maureen! Bye, Gillian!
- Bye!

354
00:22:30,576 --> 00:22:31,736
Bye, Mom.

355
00:22:31,945 --> 00:22:35,847
All right, you guys, are you ready
to go out on the boat?

356
00:22:36,015 --> 00:22:37,073
- No!
- No!

357
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,616
What happened to you?
What happened?

358
00:22:55,268 --> 00:22:56,599
Come on, one more time.

359
00:22:56,836 --> 00:22:58,497
Here, you can do that one.

360
00:23:01,107 --> 00:23:02,335
Hey!

361
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:03,998
What do we win?

362
00:23:16,055 --> 00:23:17,352
Look, look, look!

363
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,115
Yay!

364
00:23:52,325 --> 00:23:55,089
- How are the fish doing?
- Very well, I think they're very happy.

365
00:23:55,294 --> 00:23:56,420
- Are they?
- Yes.

366
00:23:56,596 --> 00:23:58,427
You guys want to go to a movie?

367
00:23:58,598 --> 00:24:00,327
No, there's nothing good playing.

368
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,832
Look! A storybook lady.

369
00:24:03,403 --> 00:24:06,429
Are we at the right time?
Yeah, let's go.

370
00:24:06,806 --> 00:24:09,104
"That it was I and I alone...

371
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:13,108
...who had the idea for
the great and daring mouse plot.

372
00:24:13,446 --> 00:24:15,607
We all have our moments
of brilliance and glory...

373
00:24:15,815 --> 00:24:18,079
...and this was mine.

374
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:19,443
'Why don't we, ' I said...

375
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:23,419
...'slip it into one of
Mrs. Pratchett's jars of sweets?

376
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:24,749
And then...

377
00:24:24,924 --> 00:24:27,791
...when she puts her dirty hand in
to grab a handful...

378
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,454
...she will grab a stinky
dead mouse instead.'

379
00:24:32,698 --> 00:24:34,893
The other four stared at me in wonder.

380
00:24:35,068 --> 00:24:39,129
Then, as the sheer genius
of the plot began to sink in...

381
00:24:39,405 --> 00:24:41,430
...they all started grinning.

382
00:24:41,707 --> 00:24:45,609
They slapped me on the back, cheered
me and danced around the classroom.

383
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:47,541
'We will do it today! ' they cried.

384
00:24:47,713 --> 00:24:50,705
'We'll do it on the way home.
You had the idea, ' they said to me.

385
00:24:50,883 --> 00:24:53,215
'So you can be the one who
puts the mouse in the jar."'

386
00:24:56,923 --> 00:24:59,790
- Who belongs to this fish?
- That's mine.

387
00:25:00,226 --> 00:25:02,592
Could you give me a hand
with these used books?

388
00:25:03,362 --> 00:25:06,627
And this is her best friend Tacy,
whose real name is Anastasia.

389
00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:10,130
And the next book, Betsy and Tacy
become friends with Tib...

390
00:25:10,403 --> 00:25:13,133
...whose real name, I am sorry
to tell you, is Thelma.

391
00:25:13,306 --> 00:25:14,933
Ew.

392
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:18,103
The illustrations are hand-tipped.

393
00:25:18,911 --> 00:25:20,936
And that's why it costs so much?

394
00:25:21,414 --> 00:25:23,473
That's why it's worth so much.

395
00:25:23,683 --> 00:25:25,310
I want all of them.

396
00:25:25,485 --> 00:25:26,577
I'll think about it.

397
00:25:26,752 --> 00:25:28,652
That's a lot for your dad
to buy at one time.

398
00:25:29,021 --> 00:25:31,148
My dad gets me all the books I want.

399
00:25:31,424 --> 00:25:33,289
That's very nice of him.

400
00:25:33,493 --> 00:25:35,620
That's not my dad.
That's my nephew.

401
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:39,093
I don't really think
that he could be your nephew.

402
00:25:39,265 --> 00:25:40,994
No, no, no. It's true.

403
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,502
Annabel is my aunt.
Isn't that right, Aunt Annabel?

404
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:50,472
- And Matt is his...
- Wait, let me guess.

405
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:52,640
Are you his uncle?

406
00:25:52,979 --> 00:25:54,173
No.

407
00:25:54,413 --> 00:25:55,778
His grandfather?

408
00:25:57,416 --> 00:25:58,815
His great-grandfather?

409
00:25:59,285 --> 00:26:01,480
I'm his brother!

410
00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:07,352
Matt is my father's son.
Annabel is my grandfather's daughter.

411
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,050
We are...

412
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:11,829
...an American family.

413
00:26:17,503 --> 00:26:18,902
Here you go, young lady.

414
00:26:19,071 --> 00:26:21,631
- What's that?
- That's a handkerchief.

415
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:24,071
Do children even know
what handkerchiefs are?

416
00:26:24,243 --> 00:26:28,145
A handkerchief is a Kleenex
that you don't throw away. See?

417
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:29,905
My mother embroidered this for me.

418
00:26:30,082 --> 00:26:33,540
My initials and a daisy, because
daisies are my favorite flower.

419
00:26:34,687 --> 00:26:36,450
May I ask who you are?

420
00:26:37,223 --> 00:26:40,488
Kathleen Kelly. I own this store.
And you are?

421
00:26:41,827 --> 00:26:43,852
Joe. Just call me Joe.

422
00:26:44,063 --> 00:26:45,325
We'll take these books.

423
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:47,388
Okay.

424
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:50,033
You're gonna come back, aren't you?

425
00:26:51,771 --> 00:26:53,739
- Of course.
- See?

426
00:26:54,006 --> 00:26:56,873
That is why we won't go under.
Our customers are loyal.

427
00:26:57,109 --> 00:26:59,168
They're opening a Fox Books
around the corner.

428
00:26:59,512 --> 00:27:02,504
- Fox Books! My daddy...
- Likes to buy discount.

429
00:27:02,682 --> 00:27:05,116
But don't tell anybody.
It's nothing to be proud of.

430
00:27:05,284 --> 00:27:06,911
F-O-X.

431
00:27:08,221 --> 00:27:10,416
That's amazing!
You can spell "fox."

432
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,683
Can you spell "dog"?

433
00:27:12,892 --> 00:27:14,291
F-O-X.

434
00:27:14,493 --> 00:27:16,927
Look at this dinosaur book.
It's a pop-up dinosaur book.

435
00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:19,620
Wouldn't you like to have
a dinosaur book like that?

436
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:22,367
Wouldn't you like to read that?

437
00:27:22,602 --> 00:27:25,935
Sit here and read Matt the book
until I take care of things.

438
00:27:26,205 --> 00:27:30,608
Whatever you do, just don't listen
to anything I say. Thank you.

439
00:27:31,377 --> 00:27:33,743
We'll take that pop-up book as well.

440
00:27:34,013 --> 00:27:38,040
The world is not driven by discounts.
I've been in business forever.

441
00:27:38,284 --> 00:27:42,448
I started helping my mother
when I was 6, and I used to watch her.

442
00:27:43,122 --> 00:27:45,647
She wasn't just selling books.

443
00:27:45,825 --> 00:27:48,760
She was helping people become
whatever they were going to be.

444
00:27:48,928 --> 00:27:51,897
When you read a book as a child,
it becomes part of your identity...

445
00:27:52,064 --> 00:27:54,555
...in a way that no other reading
in your life does.

446
00:27:54,734 --> 00:27:56,634
And I have gotten carried away.

447
00:27:57,637 --> 00:27:58,661
Yeah.

448
00:27:59,905 --> 00:28:01,532
Yeah, you have.

449
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:04,032
You've made me feel...

450
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:09,607
Enchanting.
Your mother was enchanting.

451
00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:10,941
Yes, she was.

452
00:28:11,417 --> 00:28:14,250
- How will you be paying for this?
- Cash.

453
00:28:14,954 --> 00:28:16,080
How did you know that?

454
00:28:17,123 --> 00:28:18,249
From the photograph.

455
00:28:19,358 --> 00:28:21,758
That you in the photograph?
What are you doing?

456
00:28:21,927 --> 00:28:23,155
Twirling.

457
00:28:24,497 --> 00:28:26,488
My mother and I used to twirl.

458
00:28:26,766 --> 00:28:29,667
She left the store to me,
and I'll leave it to my daughter.

459
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:32,201
- Seventy-three dollars, please.
- How much?

460
00:28:32,371 --> 00:28:34,464
73 dollars.

461
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:39,678
How old is your daughter now?

462
00:28:41,113 --> 00:28:42,671
I don't have a daughter.

463
00:28:43,149 --> 00:28:45,674
I'm not married. But eventually...

464
00:28:45,885 --> 00:28:49,218
So the big, bad Fox Books
can just go to hell.

465
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,387
- Here you go.
- Thank you. Hey, we're ready?

466
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:58,394
- That's nice.
- Bye, Kathleen.

467
00:28:58,597 --> 00:29:01,691
Goodbye, Annabel.
Goodbye, Matt.

468
00:29:04,804 --> 00:29:07,830
Matt, I have to ask you another thing.

469
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,507
Can you spell cat?

470
00:29:09,742 --> 00:29:11,573
F-O-X.

471
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:16,241
Cat. Thanks.

472
00:29:19,251 --> 00:29:21,219
Good thing it wasn't the fish.

473
00:29:22,988 --> 00:29:24,387
Take care!

474
00:30:11,604 --> 00:30:14,402
No protests, no demonstrations.

475
00:30:14,607 --> 00:30:16,040
The neighborhood loves us.

476
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:18,608
They're wondering where
we've been all these years...

477
00:30:18,778 --> 00:30:20,302
...how they did without us.

478
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:21,571
It's a hit!

479
00:30:21,747 --> 00:30:23,305
How's the children's department?

480
00:30:23,482 --> 00:30:25,416
It's early. School's not out.

481
00:30:25,584 --> 00:30:28,883
And there is that children's store nearby.
Shop Around the Corner.

482
00:30:29,088 --> 00:30:31,648
Cecilia's store. Cecilia Kelly.

483
00:30:31,824 --> 00:30:33,621
We might have had a date once.

484
00:30:33,793 --> 00:30:36,261
- Her daughter owns it now.
- We'll crush it.

485
00:30:36,495 --> 00:30:38,224
She was enchanting.

486
00:30:43,702 --> 00:30:46,296
They've been open six days.

487
00:30:46,472 --> 00:30:50,966
And we did $ 1200 less
than the same week last year.

488
00:30:51,243 --> 00:30:52,710
That could be a fluke, right?

489
00:30:53,646 --> 00:30:54,704
Or not.

490
00:30:56,115 --> 00:30:58,743
Their store is new.
It's a novelty.

491
00:30:59,018 --> 00:31:02,715
It'll all shake out. Meanwhile,
I'm putting up more twinkle lights.

492
00:31:02,922 --> 00:31:04,514
That's a fine idea.

493
00:31:04,723 --> 00:31:06,452
What if we have to fold?

494
00:31:06,725 --> 00:31:09,125
I'll never find
another part-time job.

495
00:31:09,295 --> 00:31:12,628
Then I won't be able to pay
my rent, and I'll have to move.

496
00:31:12,865 --> 00:31:14,264
To Brooklyn!

497
00:31:14,433 --> 00:31:17,334
The joy of rent control.
Six rooms...

498
00:31:17,603 --> 00:31:18,968
...450 a month.

499
00:31:19,238 --> 00:31:21,365
We know.
You've told us a million times.

500
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,998
I can't believe you're bringing
this up at a time like this.

501
00:31:25,244 --> 00:31:28,543
It's like those people who brag
because they're tall.

502
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:30,681
We are not going to fold.

503
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,483
Hey, I...

504
00:31:33,786 --> 00:31:35,276
This place is a tomb.

505
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:38,285
I'm going to the nut shop
where it's fun.

506
00:31:38,958 --> 00:31:40,323
George?

507
00:31:42,962 --> 00:31:44,452
George?

508
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,660
Miranda!

509
00:31:54,006 --> 00:31:55,496
Hi! Hi!

510
00:31:55,674 --> 00:31:58,472
Kathleen, are you surviving?

511
00:31:58,644 --> 00:32:02,808
We're so excited about your new book.
When should we schedule a signing?

512
00:32:02,982 --> 00:32:06,884
It's being published in January.
Will you be in business in January?

513
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:08,314
I'm so worried.

514
00:32:08,587 --> 00:32:09,849
We're doing great.

515
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:11,215
Aren't we?

516
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,321
No difference whatsoever!

517
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:14,583
Great.

518
00:32:14,927 --> 00:32:16,053
Thank God!

519
00:32:16,729 --> 00:32:20,859
You can count on me for anything.
Support, rallies, picket lines.

520
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,193
<i>We can get the Times
to write something.</i>

521
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:25,593
<i>Or that nut from the Observer.</i>

522
00:32:26,171 --> 00:32:27,399
What...?

523
00:32:27,573 --> 00:32:30,508
<i>- What nut in the Observer?
- Frank something-or-other.</i>

524
00:32:30,743 --> 00:32:32,711
The one who's in love
with his typewriter.

525
00:32:32,912 --> 00:32:35,437
This is just the sort of thing
that would outrage him.

526
00:32:38,317 --> 00:32:39,875
<i>A nut? She called me a nut?</i>

527
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:43,115
That's not the point.
She thinks my store is in trouble.

528
00:32:43,322 --> 00:32:46,018
Why would she say that?
There's enough business for us all.

529
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:49,285
- Yes, there is. No question.
- We are fine.

530
00:32:49,461 --> 00:32:51,361
You're more than fine.
You're absolutely fine.

531
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,861
- We are fine.
- Yes.

532
00:32:53,032 --> 00:32:54,260
How are you?

533
00:32:54,533 --> 00:32:55,727
- Fine.
- Fine.

534
00:32:55,901 --> 00:32:58,335
Vince will be so happy to see you.

535
00:32:58,771 --> 00:33:02,036
Congratulations.
Guess who I saw on the subway today?

536
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,270
This is amazing.

537
00:33:09,548 --> 00:33:11,607
"You should go to a retreat.

538
00:33:11,884 --> 00:33:14,546
You really should go to a retreat."

539
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:20,550
Honey, will you get me
another drink? I'm all out.

540
00:33:20,726 --> 00:33:22,785
"It's a really great place...

541
00:33:22,962 --> 00:33:25,260
...to calm down."

542
00:33:25,497 --> 00:33:27,397
He said that to me.
Isn't that hilarious?

543
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:34,128
Champagne, please.

544
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,501
Stoli on the rocks.
But a fresh glass, please.

545
00:33:38,911 --> 00:33:40,435
White wine, please.

546
00:33:40,746 --> 00:33:42,737
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

547
00:33:47,019 --> 00:33:48,953
Hello.

548
00:33:49,388 --> 00:33:51,583
- Hi.
- Hi.

549
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:53,849
Do you remember me,
from the bookstore?

550
00:33:54,026 --> 00:33:55,960
Of course I remember you. Yes.

551
00:33:56,462 --> 00:33:57,929
How's your aunt?

552
00:33:58,697 --> 00:33:59,959
She's great. Thanks.

553
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:01,757
I'd better go deliver this.

554
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:04,528
I have a very thirsty date.
She's part camel.

555
00:34:04,803 --> 00:34:06,794
Joe, right? Joe, isn't it?

556
00:34:07,172 --> 00:34:09,265
And you are Kathleen.

557
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,940
Kathleen Kelly.

558
00:34:16,115 --> 00:34:17,548
Two white wine, please.

559
00:34:22,788 --> 00:34:26,690
I cannot believe that
you were speaking to Joe Fox.

560
00:34:27,126 --> 00:34:29,287
- Joe Fox?
- Joe Fox.

561
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:31,026
- As in...
- As in...

562
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:33,630
...he's gonna take over everything.

563
00:34:41,807 --> 00:34:44,298
Fox? Your last name is Fox.

564
00:34:45,077 --> 00:34:46,840
F-O-X.

565
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:50,572
God! I didn't realize...

566
00:34:50,849 --> 00:34:52,476
I didn't know...

567
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:54,310
Who you were with?

568
00:34:54,486 --> 00:34:56,317
I didn't know who you were with.

569
00:34:56,488 --> 00:34:57,716
Excuse me?

570
00:34:58,524 --> 00:35:00,515
<i>It's from The Godfather.</i>

571
00:35:00,693 --> 00:35:02,388
<i>Sorry, it's from The Godfather.</i>

572
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:05,962
It's when the movie producer
realizes that Tom Hagen...

573
00:35:06,198 --> 00:35:08,723
...is an emissary of vito Corleone.

574
00:35:09,001 --> 00:35:11,026
Just before the horse's head
ends up in the bed...

575
00:35:11,203 --> 00:35:13,433
...with all the bloody sheets.
Wakes up and it's:

576
00:35:18,077 --> 00:35:19,237
Never mind.

577
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:23,609
You were spying on me, weren't you?
You probably rented those children.

578
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:24,941
Why would I spy on you?

579
00:35:25,117 --> 00:35:27,415
Because I am your competition,
which you know...

580
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:31,420
"Just around the corner."

581
00:35:32,124 --> 00:35:36,390
Our store entrance is around the corner.
There's no other way to say it.

582
00:35:36,628 --> 00:35:39,722
It's not the name of our store.
It's where it is.

583
00:35:39,998 --> 00:35:43,593
And you do not own the phrase
"around the corner."

584
00:35:46,705 --> 00:35:47,865
What is that?

585
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,264
What are you doing?

586
00:35:50,075 --> 00:35:51,542
What is that? What are you doing?

587
00:35:52,044 --> 00:35:55,013
You're taking all the caviar?
That caviar is a garnish.

588
00:36:01,253 --> 00:36:03,585
The reason I came into your store...

589
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:06,758
...is because I was spending the day
with Annabel and Matt.

590
00:36:06,925 --> 00:36:08,256
I was buying them presents.

591
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:11,555
I'm the type of guy who likes to buy
his way into the hearts of children...

592
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:12,890
...who are his relatives.

593
00:36:13,065 --> 00:36:16,432
There was only one place to find
a children's book in the neighborhood.

594
00:36:16,602 --> 00:36:17,899
That won't always be the case.

595
00:36:18,103 --> 00:36:19,832
And it was yours.
And it is...

596
00:36:20,172 --> 00:36:22,140
...a charming little bookstore.

597
00:36:22,341 --> 00:36:25,833
You probably sell, what,
$350,000 worth of books in a year?

598
00:36:26,111 --> 00:36:27,271
How did you know that?

599
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:28,741
I'm in the book business.

600
00:36:29,915 --> 00:36:31,405
I am in the book business.

601
00:36:33,352 --> 00:36:34,614
I see.

602
00:36:35,287 --> 00:36:36,948
And we are the Price Club.

603
00:36:37,122 --> 00:36:40,558
Only instead of a 10-gallon vat
of olive oil for 3.99...

604
00:36:40,793 --> 00:36:44,593
...that won't even fit under your
kitchen cabinet, we sell cheap books.

605
00:36:44,763 --> 00:36:47,129
Me, a spy? Absolutely.

606
00:36:47,366 --> 00:36:51,803
I have in my possession the secret
printout of the sales figures...

607
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:55,133
...of a bookstore so inconsequential,
yet full of its own virtue...

608
00:36:55,307 --> 00:36:59,073
...that I had to rush over for fear
it will put me out of business.

609
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,945
What? What?

610
00:37:04,116 --> 00:37:06,482
Hey. How you doing? Frank Navasky.

611
00:37:07,286 --> 00:37:08,810
Joe Fox.

612
00:37:09,655 --> 00:37:11,384
- Joe Fox?
- F-O-X.

613
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:14,220
The inventor of the superstore.
Of course.

614
00:37:14,493 --> 00:37:16,324
The enemy of the mid-list novel.

615
00:37:16,595 --> 00:37:17,823
The destroyer of City Books.

616
00:37:17,996 --> 00:37:20,658
Tell me something, really.
How do you sleep at night?

617
00:37:20,966 --> 00:37:23,958
I use a wonderful
over-the-counter drug:

618
00:37:24,203 --> 00:37:25,500
Ultra-dorm.

619
00:37:25,704 --> 00:37:27,365
Don't take the whole thing, just half.

620
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:29,666
You'll wake up without
even the tiniest hangover.

621
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,366
- You're Frank Navasky, aren't you?
- Yes. Leaving.

622
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,512
<i>Your last piece in the Observer...</i>

623
00:37:34,746 --> 00:37:37,306
...about Anthony Powell was brilliant.

624
00:37:38,617 --> 00:37:40,244
- Really?
- Brilliant. Yes.

625
00:37:40,752 --> 00:37:42,117
I'm Patricia Eden.

626
00:37:42,354 --> 00:37:44,015
Hi. Eden Books.

627
00:37:44,223 --> 00:37:47,317
Joe, this man is the greatest
living expert...

628
00:37:47,492 --> 00:37:49,016
...on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.

629
00:37:49,228 --> 00:37:50,627
You really liked my...?

630
00:37:50,829 --> 00:37:52,262
This is Kathleen Kelly.

631
00:37:52,497 --> 00:37:55,898
My piece? I just...
You know? I'm flattered.

632
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:58,502
You write these things.
You think somebody'll mention them.

633
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,900
A week goes by, the phone
doesn't ring and you think:

634
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:03,564
"I'm a fraud.
I'm a failure or something."

635
00:38:03,842 --> 00:38:06,709
You know what fascinated me
about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg?

636
00:38:06,945 --> 00:38:10,346
Is how old they looked,
when they were really just our age.

637
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:12,874
You know?

638
00:38:13,418 --> 00:38:16,046
I'm so happy to have finally met you.

639
00:38:17,022 --> 00:38:19,388
We will talk. Have you ever
thought about doing a book?

640
00:38:19,558 --> 00:38:21,788
It's crossed my mind,
something relevant for today...

641
00:38:22,027 --> 00:38:24,928
...like the Luddite movement in
19th century England. We should talk.

642
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:26,223
Call me.

643
00:38:26,398 --> 00:38:28,889
Hon, have you ever had
a caviar garnish?

644
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,535
I had no idea Frank Navasky...

645
00:38:38,744 --> 00:38:40,769
...was going to be so down-to-earth.

646
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:43,073
You read his stuff...

647
00:38:43,315 --> 00:38:46,045
...you think he's going to be
so obscure and abstruse.

648
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:49,118
He's always talking about Heidegger...

649
00:38:49,388 --> 00:38:50,753
...and Foucault.

650
00:38:50,989 --> 00:38:54,254
And I have no idea what
any of it's about, really.

651
00:39:00,999 --> 00:39:03,126
I'm not tired. I'm not.

652
00:39:18,717 --> 00:39:22,710
<i>Do you ever feel you've become
the worst version of yourself?</i>

653
00:39:26,725 --> 00:39:30,456
<i>That a Pandora's box of
all the secret, hateful parts...</i>

654
00:39:30,729 --> 00:39:32,856
<i>... your arrogance, your spite...</i>

655
00:39:33,131 --> 00:39:34,462
<i>... your condescension...</i>

656
00:39:34,733 --> 00:39:36,428
<i>... has sprung open?</i>

657
00:39:36,635 --> 00:39:39,263
<i>Someone provokes you,
and instead of smiling...</i>

658
00:39:39,504 --> 00:39:42,371
<i>... and moving on, you zing them?</i>

659
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:45,132
<i>"Hello, it's Mr. Nasty."</i>

660
00:39:45,978 --> 00:39:49,379
<i>I'm sure you have no idea
what I'm talking about.</i>

661
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:53,147
<i>No, I know what you mean,
and I'm completely jealous.</i>

662
00:39:55,253 --> 00:39:59,690
<i>What happens to me when I'm provoked
is that I get tongue-tied. My mind goes...</i>

663
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:01,183
Blank.

664
00:40:04,296 --> 00:40:06,491
<i>Then I spend all night
tossing and turning...</i>

665
00:40:06,765 --> 00:40:09,199
<i>... trying to figure out
what I should've said.</i>

666
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:14,839
<i>What should I have said,
for example, to the...</i>

667
00:40:15,007 --> 00:40:18,670
Bottom-dweller...

668
00:40:20,412 --> 00:40:24,041
...who recently belittled
my existence?

669
00:40:33,191 --> 00:40:34,590
Nothing.

670
00:40:35,293 --> 00:40:36,658
Nothing. Even now.

671
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:37,987
<i>Even now...</i>

672
00:40:38,163 --> 00:40:39,187
Days later...

673
00:40:39,364 --> 00:40:40,797
<i>I can't figure it out.</i>

674
00:40:41,299 --> 00:40:45,099
<i>Wouldn't it be wonderful if I could
pass all my zingers to you?</i>

675
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:49,101
<i>Then I'd never behave badly and
you could behave badly all the time.</i>

676
00:40:49,307 --> 00:40:50,535
<i>And we'd both be happy.</i>

677
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:52,370
<i>On the other hand, I must warn you:</i>

678
00:40:52,544 --> 00:40:56,071
<i>When you finally have the pleasure
of saying the thing you mean to say...</i>

679
00:40:56,248 --> 00:41:00,116
<i>... at the moment you mean to say it,
remorse inevitably follows.</i>

680
00:41:05,524 --> 00:41:08,118
<i>Do you think we should meet?</i>

681
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,598
Meet?

682
00:41:20,205 --> 00:41:21,934
Oh, my God...

683
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:26,031
Seventy-two twenty-seven.

684
00:42:28,206 --> 00:42:30,333
This is a cash-only line.

685
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,707
- What?
- Cash only.

686
00:42:34,546 --> 00:42:36,514
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

687
00:42:36,681 --> 00:42:39,844
I just have a credit card.
I'm sorry. Is that okay?

688
00:42:40,051 --> 00:42:41,484
No, it's not okay.

689
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,012
There's a sign.

690
00:42:44,222 --> 00:42:46,019
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

691
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:50,159
I never do this, but I'm asking you to
make an exception in this one case.

692
00:42:50,328 --> 00:42:51,852
You have no cash?

693
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:54,121
- She has no cash.
- No, she has no cash.

694
00:42:54,299 --> 00:42:55,789
Get on another line, lady.

695
00:42:55,967 --> 00:42:57,332
I have a dollar.
That's all.

696
00:42:57,502 --> 00:42:59,197
I have a dollar. One dollar.

697
00:42:59,671 --> 00:43:01,536
- Is there anything you can do?
- Hello.

698
00:43:02,007 --> 00:43:04,237
- Hello.
- Hi. You need some money?

699
00:43:04,476 --> 00:43:07,001
No, I do not need any money.
Thank you very much.

700
00:43:07,179 --> 00:43:09,670
- Get in another line.
- Hi.

701
00:43:09,948 --> 00:43:11,347
Rose.

702
00:43:11,516 --> 00:43:13,484
That is a great name. Rose.

703
00:43:13,885 --> 00:43:15,716
This is Kathleen.
I'm Joe...

704
00:43:15,987 --> 00:43:17,181
And I'm Henry.

705
00:43:17,455 --> 00:43:19,150
Henry, how are you?
Happy holidays.

706
00:43:19,391 --> 00:43:21,586
This is a credit card machine.

707
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:23,319
Happy Thanksgiving.

708
00:43:24,896 --> 00:43:27,387
It's your turn to say
"Happy Thanksgiving" back.

709
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,464
Happy Thanksgiving back.

710
00:43:29,901 --> 00:43:31,232
Knock, knock.

711
00:43:31,836 --> 00:43:34,100
- Who's there?
- Orange.

712
00:43:34,973 --> 00:43:36,031
Orange who?

713
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:38,005
"Orange" you going to
give us a break...

714
00:43:38,176 --> 00:43:41,339
...by zipping this credit card
through the credit card machine?

715
00:43:42,214 --> 00:43:44,409
Come on, you can do it.
Zip, zip.

716
00:43:45,383 --> 00:43:46,475
There you go.

717
00:43:47,852 --> 00:43:49,251
Rose?

718
00:43:50,388 --> 00:43:52,788
That is a great name.

719
00:43:53,491 --> 00:43:54,890
So you're fine.

720
00:43:55,093 --> 00:43:56,117
Fine.

721
00:43:56,294 --> 00:43:59,263
Happy Thanksgiving.
Henry, happy Thanksgiving.

722
00:44:00,398 --> 00:44:01,865
I'm so sorry. Really.

723
00:44:02,033 --> 00:44:05,002
- I apologize from the bottom of my heart.
- So sign already!

724
00:44:05,537 --> 00:44:08,438
- I'd like to get home for the parade.
- You have my pen.

725
00:45:11,703 --> 00:45:13,967
- Wonderful!
- Thank you.

726
00:45:56,247 --> 00:45:57,305
I got it.

727
00:46:53,972 --> 00:46:56,873
<i>It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees</i>

728
00:46:57,542 --> 00:46:59,703
<i>Do you know that Joni Mitchell song?</i>

729
00:46:59,944 --> 00:47:02,970
<i>I wish I had a river
I could skate away on</i>

730
00:47:03,248 --> 00:47:06,581
<i>Such a sad song. And not
really about Christmas at all.</i>

731
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:10,812
<i>But I was thinking about it tonight
as I was decorating my Christmas tree.</i>

732
00:47:11,089 --> 00:47:13,614
<i>Unwrapping funky ornaments
made of Popsicle sticks...</i>

733
00:47:13,892 --> 00:47:17,089
<i>... and missing my mother so much
I almost couldn't breathe.</i>

734
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:20,421
<i>I always miss my mother at Christmas.</i>

735
00:47:20,698 --> 00:47:24,828
<i>But somehow it is worse this year
since I need some advice from her.</i>

736
00:47:25,103 --> 00:47:26,832
<i>I need her to make me some cocoa...</i>

737
00:47:27,005 --> 00:47:31,339
<i>... and tell me that everything that's
going badly in my life will sort itself out.</i>

738
00:47:33,845 --> 00:47:36,905
<i>What kind of advice do you need?
Can I help?</i>

739
00:47:43,488 --> 00:47:45,012
<i>Can you help?</i>

740
00:47:47,091 --> 00:47:48,786
<i>I wish you could help.</i>

741
00:47:50,995 --> 00:47:52,223
<i>I wish...</i>

742
00:47:54,299 --> 00:47:56,233
<i>I had a gut feeling
you'd be online now.</i>

743
00:47:56,634 --> 00:47:58,158
Hi.

744
00:47:59,471 --> 00:48:02,599
<i>I can give you advice.
I'm great at advice.</i>

745
00:48:13,051 --> 00:48:15,110
<i>If only you could help.</i>

746
00:48:19,557 --> 00:48:21,184
<i>Is it about love?</i>

747
00:48:21,459 --> 00:48:22,858
Please say no.

748
00:48:23,862 --> 00:48:26,160
No. How cute is that?

749
00:48:26,331 --> 00:48:28,299
<i>My business is in trouble.</i>

750
00:48:31,069 --> 00:48:32,331
Well...

751
00:48:35,974 --> 00:48:38,067
<i>I'm a brilliant businessman.</i>

752
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:40,341
<i>It's what I do best.</i>

753
00:48:40,578 --> 00:48:42,205
<i>What's your business?</i>

754
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,671
No.

755
00:48:44,849 --> 00:48:47,340
<i>No specifics. Remember?</i>

756
00:48:48,486 --> 00:48:50,386
Okay.

757
00:48:52,357 --> 00:48:58,193
<i>Well, minus specifics,
it's hard to help except to say...</i>

758
00:48:58,429 --> 00:48:59,862
...go to the mattresses.

759
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:03,497
"Except to say go to the matt..."

760
00:49:04,869 --> 00:49:06,336
What?

761
00:49:07,705 --> 00:49:08,797
What does that mean?

762
00:49:09,674 --> 00:49:13,303
<i>It's from The Godfather.
It means you have to go to war.</i>

763
00:49:16,014 --> 00:49:19,108
<i>What is it with men and The Godfather?</i>

764
00:49:19,384 --> 00:49:20,510
Hello?

765
00:49:22,921 --> 00:49:24,855
Come on. Hello?

766
00:49:25,557 --> 00:49:26,819
Well...

767
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:29,258
Well, what can I...

768
00:49:29,594 --> 00:49:30,891
Michael...

769
00:49:31,362 --> 00:49:34,354
<i>The Godfather is the I Ching.</i>

770
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,868
<i>The Godfather
is the sum of all wisdom.</i>

771
00:49:39,137 --> 00:49:41,731
<i>The Godfather is the answer
to any question.</i>

772
00:49:41,973 --> 00:49:44,066
<i>What should I pack
for my summer vacation?</i>

773
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:46,366
<i>"Leave the gun. Take the cannoli."</i>

774
00:49:47,478 --> 00:49:49,571
<i>What day of the week is it?</i>

775
00:49:50,381 --> 00:49:53,873
"Monday, Tuesday,
Thursday, Wednesday."

776
00:49:54,652 --> 00:49:59,419
<i>The answer to your question is:
"Go to the mattresses."</i>

777
00:50:00,425 --> 00:50:02,950
<i>You're at war.
"It's not personal, it's business.</i>

778
00:50:03,227 --> 00:50:06,719
<i>It's not personal.
It's business."</i>

779
00:50:07,098 --> 00:50:12,058
<i>Recite that to yourself every time
you feel you're losing your nerve.</i>

780
00:50:14,672 --> 00:50:16,264
<i>I know you worry about being brave.</i>

781
00:50:16,441 --> 00:50:17,772
Don't.

782
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:20,441
<i>This is your chance.</i>

783
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:22,410
<i>Fight!</i>

784
00:50:23,081 --> 00:50:24,275
<i>Fight to the death!</i>

785
00:50:24,482 --> 00:50:26,473
Fight to the death.

786
00:50:31,089 --> 00:50:33,455
It's not personal.
It's business. Just fight!

787
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:34,649
Fight, fight, fight!

788
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:40,692
- Hey.
- Hey.

789
00:50:44,335 --> 00:50:45,927
I've been thinking.

790
00:50:46,938 --> 00:50:48,462
- Frank.
- What?

791
00:50:49,207 --> 00:50:51,107
I've decided to go the mattresses.

792
00:50:51,309 --> 00:50:56,110
Do you think it would be a conflict of
interest if you wrote about the store?

793
00:50:56,314 --> 00:50:58,305
- Yes.
- Yes?

794
00:50:58,916 --> 00:51:00,281
No.

795
00:51:00,818 --> 00:51:02,285
So you'll do it?

796
00:51:02,854 --> 00:51:05,220
Yes. Yes.

797
00:51:05,423 --> 00:51:07,550
Do you know what it is
to go to the mattresses?

798
00:51:07,792 --> 00:51:09,282
<i>From The Godfather.</i>

799
00:51:13,197 --> 00:51:15,222
Good morning, Shop Around the Corner.

800
00:51:15,433 --> 00:51:16,866
George speaking, may I help you?

801
00:51:17,502 --> 00:51:20,300
Kathleen,
the Channel 2 truck just pulled up.

802
00:51:20,471 --> 00:51:21,495
In a second.

803
00:51:21,673 --> 00:51:23,402
Everyone's read the article.

804
00:51:23,574 --> 00:51:26,941
"So you do not have to look
to the usual places...

805
00:51:27,178 --> 00:51:29,169
...where good and evil face off...

806
00:51:29,447 --> 00:51:33,645
...the places Herodotus called
'the happy land of absolutes.'

807
00:51:34,185 --> 00:51:37,211
We have the perfect example
here on the West Side...

808
00:51:37,488 --> 00:51:40,480
...where the cold cash cow,
Fox Books...

809
00:51:40,725 --> 00:51:42,750
...threatens survival of a temple...

810
00:51:43,027 --> 00:51:46,588
...to one of the twentieth century's
most profound truths:

811
00:51:46,831 --> 00:51:48,765
You are what you read."

812
00:51:49,167 --> 00:51:50,691
I believe that.

813
00:51:51,202 --> 00:51:53,067
"Save The Shop Around the Corner...

814
00:51:53,337 --> 00:51:55,862
...and you will save your soul."

815
00:51:57,742 --> 00:52:00,108
Frank, that's charming.

816
00:52:00,745 --> 00:52:02,042
Think it's a little over the top?

817
00:52:02,213 --> 00:52:05,046
<i>That was The Village Voice.
I told them to come over whenever.</i>

818
00:52:05,216 --> 00:52:06,683
Oh, man.

819
00:52:07,985 --> 00:52:10,419
Float like a butterfly.
Sting like a bee.

820
00:52:10,621 --> 00:52:12,111
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

821
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:13,917
<i>We don't want your superstore!</i>

822
00:52:14,192 --> 00:52:18,561
<i>Five, six, seven, eight!
Go away and close the gate!</i>

823
00:52:18,796 --> 00:52:20,889
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

824
00:52:21,132 --> 00:52:23,896
"We don't want this superstore."

825
00:52:24,068 --> 00:52:25,899
- Is that what they're saying?
- Catchy.

826
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:28,538
- Well, who wrote that?
- Annoying.

827
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,630
Pissing me off, actually.

828
00:52:30,808 --> 00:52:32,105
Do you want the West Side...

829
00:52:32,276 --> 00:52:35,473
...to become one big,
gigantic strip mall?

830
00:52:35,646 --> 00:52:37,113
No!

831
00:52:37,315 --> 00:52:40,614
Do you want to get off the subway
at 72nd and Broadway...

832
00:52:40,885 --> 00:52:43,945
...and not even know
you're in New York City?

833
00:52:44,255 --> 00:52:47,088
Can we save
The Shop Around the Corner?

834
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:48,622
Yes!

835
00:52:48,893 --> 00:52:50,986
<i>We're here in front of
The Shop Around the Corner...</i>

836
00:52:51,162 --> 00:52:53,460
<i>... the famous West Side
children's bookstore...</i>

837
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:56,156
<i>... now on the verge of having
to close its doors...</i>

838
00:52:56,334 --> 00:52:58,325
<i>... because the big bad wolf,
Fox Books...</i>

839
00:52:58,536 --> 00:53:00,663
<i>... has opened only
a few hundred feet away...</i>

840
00:53:00,938 --> 00:53:05,068
<i>... wooing customers with its sharp
discounts and designer coffee.</i>

841
00:53:06,277 --> 00:53:08,108
<i>They have to have
discounts and lattes...</i>

842
00:53:08,279 --> 00:53:10,474
<i>... because their workers
have never read a book.</i>

843
00:53:10,648 --> 00:53:13,583
She's not as nice as she seems on TV.

844
00:53:13,818 --> 00:53:15,581
- You met her?
- Yeah.

845
00:53:15,753 --> 00:53:17,687
Boy, she's a pill.

846
00:53:18,156 --> 00:53:20,283
Probably ain't as fine
as she look on TV either.

847
00:53:20,858 --> 00:53:25,352
Oh, no, no. She's beautiful.
But she's a pill.

848
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:26,756
You don't feel bad...

849
00:53:26,931 --> 00:53:30,423
...about sending her ass back
to the projects with food stamps?

850
00:53:30,635 --> 00:53:32,159
Broke, single, white lady.

851
00:53:32,436 --> 00:53:33,528
It's not personal.

852
00:53:33,704 --> 00:53:35,569
- It's business.
- Yeah.

853
00:53:35,773 --> 00:53:38,173
Hey, here's a good-looking guy!

854
00:53:38,442 --> 00:53:41,070
<i>I sell cheap books.
I do. So sue me.</i>

855
00:53:41,612 --> 00:53:44,206
<i>And that, in a nutshell,
is the Fox Books philosophy.</i>

856
00:53:45,149 --> 00:53:46,173
That's what you said?

857
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:47,840
<i>Discount them and sell them.</i>

858
00:53:48,019 --> 00:53:49,577
That's not all I said.

859
00:53:49,821 --> 00:53:52,483
I can't believe those bastards.
I said we were great!

860
00:53:52,723 --> 00:53:55,157
I said you could read for hours
and no one will bother you.

861
00:53:55,393 --> 00:53:58,624
I said we had 150,000 titles. I showed
them the New York City section.

862
00:53:58,796 --> 00:54:00,889
I said we were a goddamn piazza.

863
00:54:01,499 --> 00:54:03,524
A place in this city where
people could mingle.

864
00:54:03,701 --> 00:54:04,725
Piazza?

865
00:54:04,902 --> 00:54:06,529
I was eloquent!

866
00:54:06,904 --> 00:54:08,997
- Shit!
- A piazza.

867
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:12,867
It's inevitable. People want
to turn her into Joan of Arc.

868
00:54:13,144 --> 00:54:14,873
And you into Attila the Hun.

869
00:54:15,146 --> 00:54:18,013
Not me personally,
but the company, yeah.

870
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:20,683
<i>I have met Joe Fox.</i>

871
00:54:21,352 --> 00:54:24,879
<i>I've heard him compare
his store to a Price Club...</i>

872
00:54:25,156 --> 00:54:27,624
<i>... and the books in it
to cans of olive oil.</i>

873
00:54:31,762 --> 00:54:34,697
<i>The bookstore, tell us about it.</i>

874
00:54:36,234 --> 00:54:41,331
<i>The Shop Around the Corner has
a kind of Jeffersonian purity to it...</i>

875
00:54:41,572 --> 00:54:46,168
<i>... that the city needs in order
to maintain historical integrity.</i>

876
00:54:46,344 --> 00:54:47,675
<i>Jeffersonian purity.</i>

877
00:54:47,845 --> 00:54:49,870
That was nice. Thank you.
Thank you. Sounded good.

878
00:54:50,214 --> 00:54:52,148
- Are you taping this?
- Yeah, I'm taping this.

879
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:54,910
<i>Technologically speaking,
the world's out of hand.</i>

880
00:54:55,186 --> 00:54:56,778
<i>Take the VCR.</i>

881
00:54:57,154 --> 00:55:01,386
<i>The whole idea behind the VCR
is that it makes it possible...</i>

882
00:55:01,659 --> 00:55:05,151
<i>... for you to tape what's on TV
when you leave the house.</i>

883
00:55:05,396 --> 00:55:07,796
<i>The whole idea
behind leaving the house...</i>

884
00:55:08,065 --> 00:55:11,592
<i>... is so you can miss
what's on television.</i>

885
00:55:11,769 --> 00:55:13,703
- I've heard you say that before.
- She hasn't.

886
00:55:13,905 --> 00:55:15,167
<i>Absolutely.</i>

887
00:55:15,406 --> 00:55:16,805
<i>Right.</i>

888
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:18,607
She gets it.

889
00:55:18,876 --> 00:55:20,810
<i>Radio. There's a medium
I can get behind.</i>

890
00:55:22,179 --> 00:55:23,771
You gonna start collecting radios now?

891
00:55:23,948 --> 00:55:25,245
<i>We're on television.</i>

892
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:28,109
<i>- You're good at it.
- No, no, no.</i>

893
00:55:28,753 --> 00:55:29,777
Frank.

894
00:55:30,821 --> 00:55:32,618
She's coming on to you.

895
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:34,790
They do this on television.

896
00:55:34,959 --> 00:55:36,256
<i>The Shop Around the Corner...</i>

897
00:55:36,427 --> 00:55:38,952
<i>... it's a true New York treasure.</i>

898
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:40,458
<i>As are you.</i>

899
00:55:44,101 --> 00:55:46,262
<i>Honestly, I'd love to have you back.</i>

900
00:55:46,604 --> 00:55:48,003
Is she sweating?

901
00:55:48,339 --> 00:55:50,830
She's touching herself.
And she's sweating.

902
00:55:51,008 --> 00:55:52,100
<i>Anytime.</i>

903
00:55:54,312 --> 00:55:55,609
We can turn it off.

904
00:55:55,846 --> 00:55:57,143
Oh, my God.

905
00:55:57,415 --> 00:56:00,578
<i>I just want to say that
yours is the only show I watch.</i>

906
00:56:01,085 --> 00:56:02,143
Oh, my God.

907
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,413
No. I was being polite.

908
00:56:04,588 --> 00:56:06,579
<i>- Thank you, Frank Navasky.
- No, thank you're.</i>

909
00:56:06,757 --> 00:56:08,418
<i>"Thank you're"?
I'm sorry.</i>

910
00:56:08,659 --> 00:56:09,990
Thank you're?

911
00:56:10,161 --> 00:56:12,152
<i>Thank you're, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

912
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:15,498
I slobbered all over her, didn't I?

913
00:56:16,367 --> 00:56:18,995
But I think that
there's something there.

914
00:56:31,629 --> 00:56:35,622
So first, I gotta go get
some eucalyptus candles...

915
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:39,358
...because it makes
my apartment smell mossy.

916
00:56:39,904 --> 00:56:42,964
Then I'm going to the market,
and I can't decide whether to get...

917
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,232
...sausage for the meat sauce,
or chopped meat.

918
00:56:46,644 --> 00:56:48,134
Spare us.

919
00:56:48,345 --> 00:56:49,642
You know what? Clam sauce.

920
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:51,714
Because this is a big date.

921
00:56:57,154 --> 00:56:59,622
Don't tell me.
Not the slightest difference?

922
00:57:01,425 --> 00:57:03,120
How can that be?

923
00:57:03,394 --> 00:57:06,852
All this publicity
and not one bit of difference?

924
00:57:08,432 --> 00:57:10,866
Birdie, what am I going to do?

925
00:57:11,569 --> 00:57:13,366
What would Mom have done?

926
00:57:14,405 --> 00:57:17,306
Well, let's ask her.

927
00:57:20,811 --> 00:57:23,871
Cecilia, what should we do?

928
00:57:25,649 --> 00:57:27,446
Birdie?

929
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,150
She has no idea.

930
00:57:30,421 --> 00:57:33,879
But she thinks
the window display is lovely.

931
00:57:38,963 --> 00:57:41,261
- Good night, dearie.
- Good night.

932
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,140
<i>I need help.</i>

933
00:58:00,284 --> 00:58:01,911
<i>Do you still want to meet me?</i>

934
00:58:05,055 --> 00:58:07,956
<i>I would love to meet you.
Where? When?</i>

935
00:58:08,425 --> 00:58:12,418
So I suppose she's carrying a copy
of a book with a flower in it?

936
00:58:14,431 --> 00:58:15,830
Not really?

937
00:58:16,133 --> 00:58:18,294
She could be a real dog, man.

938
00:58:18,535 --> 00:58:20,332
I'm only staying 10 minutes.

939
00:58:20,804 --> 00:58:24,296
I'll say hello, have a cup
of coffee and then I'll split.

940
00:58:25,042 --> 00:58:28,534
<i>Hope she doesn't have a squeaky voice
like the mice in Cinderella.</i>

941
00:58:28,812 --> 00:58:33,146
Why am I doing this?
Why am I compelled to meet her? Why?

942
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:36,212
Relax. You're just taking it
to the next level.

943
00:58:36,487 --> 00:58:37,749
I always do that.

944
00:58:37,955 --> 00:58:40,185
I always take a relationship
to the next level.

945
00:58:40,357 --> 00:58:43,952
If that works out, I take it
to the next level after that.

946
00:58:44,194 --> 00:58:48,255
Till I reach that level where
it becomes absolutely necessary...

947
00:58:48,532 --> 00:58:50,056
...for me to leave.

948
00:58:51,035 --> 00:58:54,664
I won't stay that long anyway.
I already said that, didn't I?

949
00:58:54,872 --> 00:58:56,499
Yes, you did.

950
00:59:00,477 --> 00:59:03,742
Well, okay. Caf Lalo. This is it.

951
00:59:04,848 --> 00:59:07,544
Eight o'clock.
We got here fast, didn't we?

952
00:59:07,985 --> 00:59:09,213
Kevin...

953
00:59:10,387 --> 00:59:13,550
...this woman is the most adorable
creature I've ever been in contact with.

954
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:17,591
If she turns out even to be
as good-looking as a mailbox...

955
00:59:17,861 --> 00:59:21,695
...I'd be crazy not to turn my life
upside down and marry her.

956
00:59:22,399 --> 00:59:24,390
She could be a real dog.

957
00:59:24,568 --> 00:59:26,035
But good luck.

958
00:59:30,274 --> 00:59:32,139
Would you go and look for me?

959
00:59:32,409 --> 00:59:35,537
Go look through the window
and check her out. Please?

960
00:59:35,713 --> 00:59:37,044
All right.

961
00:59:38,615 --> 00:59:40,708
- You're pathetic, man.
- Ha-ha-ha.

962
00:59:43,721 --> 00:59:45,552
All right. I'll see what I see.

963
00:59:46,423 --> 00:59:47,617
You see her?

964
00:59:48,325 --> 00:59:49,917
Wait, yeah.

965
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:52,656
I see a very beautiful girl.

966
00:59:53,263 --> 00:59:55,288
She's fine. She's fine.

967
00:59:55,733 --> 00:59:57,428
- I knew it.
- She's gorgeous.

968
00:59:57,601 --> 00:59:59,125
I knew she would be.

969
00:59:59,403 --> 01:00:00,836
But no book.

970
01:00:04,308 --> 01:00:07,402
All right. Okay, wait.
Wait a minute.

971
01:00:07,644 --> 01:00:10,807
There's a book with a flower.
So this got to be her.

972
01:00:11,081 --> 01:00:12,548
What does she look like?

973
01:00:13,117 --> 01:00:14,345
Can't see. Waiter's blocking.

974
01:00:14,651 --> 01:00:15,845
Damn it!

975
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,111
Hold on, he's moving.

976
01:00:18,655 --> 01:00:20,247
Yeah?

977
01:00:20,424 --> 01:00:21,550
Can you see her?

978
01:00:23,427 --> 01:00:25,088
Can you see her?

979
01:00:26,263 --> 01:00:27,355
Yeah.

980
01:00:27,631 --> 01:00:29,121
And?

981
01:00:31,068 --> 01:00:32,501
She's very pretty.

982
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:34,135
She is!

983
01:00:34,371 --> 01:00:36,805
I knew she would be!
She had to be!

984
01:00:37,074 --> 01:00:39,338
She had to be!

985
01:00:41,011 --> 01:00:42,171
You know what?

986
01:00:42,379 --> 01:00:43,607
She look...

987
01:00:44,815 --> 01:00:48,216
I mean, she almost has
the same coloring as...

988
01:00:48,786 --> 01:00:51,482
...that Kathleen Kelly person.
Kathleen Kelly of the bookstore?

989
01:00:51,688 --> 01:00:53,383
Why not?
You thought she was attractive.

990
01:00:53,624 --> 01:00:56,821
Absolutely. Why not?
Who cares about Kathleen Kelly?

991
01:00:57,094 --> 01:01:00,393
Well, if you don't like
Kathleen Kelly...

992
01:01:00,731 --> 01:01:02,858
...I can tell you right now...

993
01:01:03,367 --> 01:01:05,164
...you ain't gonna like this girl.

994
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:07,302
Why not?

995
01:01:08,672 --> 01:01:10,469
Because it is Kathleen Kelly.

996
01:01:23,821 --> 01:01:25,652
What are you going to do?

997
01:01:29,226 --> 01:01:30,625
Nothing.

998
01:01:31,395 --> 01:01:33,192
You just gonna let her
wait there all night?

999
01:01:33,363 --> 01:01:35,558
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

1000
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,266
Good night.
I'll see you in the morning.

1001
01:01:48,412 --> 01:01:49,902
Do you mind if I borrow this chair?

1002
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,877
Yes, I mind. Sorry.

1003
01:01:52,149 --> 01:01:53,946
I'm expecting someone.

1004
01:02:07,965 --> 01:02:10,024
Would you like another tea?

1005
01:02:10,434 --> 01:02:11,924
Yes. Thank you.

1006
01:02:45,235 --> 01:02:47,100
Kathleen Kelly.

1007
01:02:47,571 --> 01:02:50,472
Hello. This is a coincidence.
Would you mind if I sat down?

1008
01:02:50,741 --> 01:02:53,801
Yes, I would, actually.
I'm expecting someone.

1009
01:02:55,012 --> 01:02:56,570
<i>Pride and Prejudice.</i>

1010
01:02:56,813 --> 01:02:57,905
Do you mind?

1011
01:02:58,081 --> 01:03:01,141
I bet you read that book every year.
I bet you just love that...

1012
01:03:01,418 --> 01:03:03,079
...Mr. Darcy.

1013
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:06,517
Your sentimental heart beats
wildly at the thought he and...

1014
01:03:06,723 --> 01:03:11,490
...whatever her name is are truly,
honestly going to end up together.

1015
01:03:15,332 --> 01:03:17,596
- Can I get you something?
- No, he's not staying.

1016
01:03:17,768 --> 01:03:19,360
Mochaccino decaf, nonfat.

1017
01:03:19,536 --> 01:03:21,504
You are not staying.

1018
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:23,663
I'll just stay here until
your friend gets here.

1019
01:03:25,175 --> 01:03:26,301
Gee, is he late?

1020
01:03:26,643 --> 01:03:29,806
<i>The heroine of Pride and Prejudice
is Elizabeth Bennet.</i>

1021
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:33,539
She is a great and complex character.
Not that you would know.

1022
01:03:33,817 --> 01:03:35,648
As a matter of fact, I've read it.

1023
01:03:35,886 --> 01:03:37,114
Well, good for you.

1024
01:03:37,854 --> 01:03:40,049
You'd discover a lot
if you really knew me.

1025
01:03:40,657 --> 01:03:42,318
I know what I'd find.

1026
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:46,552
Instead of a brain, a cash register.
Instead of a heart, a bottom line.

1027
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,292
What?

1028
01:03:51,535 --> 01:03:53,833
- I just had a breakthrough.
- What is it?

1029
01:03:54,004 --> 01:03:58,907
For the first time, when confronted
with a horrible, insensitive person...

1030
01:03:59,176 --> 01:04:01,644
...I knew exactly what I
wanted to say, and I said it.

1031
01:04:02,312 --> 01:04:06,009
You have a gift for it. That was a
perfect blend of poetry and meanness.

1032
01:04:06,516 --> 01:04:08,381
Meanness?
Let me tell you about meanness.

1033
01:04:08,552 --> 01:04:12,044
Don't misunderstand me.
I'm trying to pay you a compliment.

1034
01:04:12,789 --> 01:04:14,188
- What are you doing?
- What is this?

1035
01:04:14,391 --> 01:04:17,485
Is this a red Rose?
No, it's a crimson Rose.

1036
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:19,355
Something you read about in a book.

1037
01:04:19,529 --> 01:04:23,522
It's funny to you, isn't it?
Everything is a joke to you.

1038
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:34,438
Please leave.

1039
01:04:34,678 --> 01:04:36,305
Please leave, I beg you.

1040
01:04:44,021 --> 01:04:45,386
Thank you.

1041
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:09,736
That hanky reminds me
of the first day I met you.

1042
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,880
First day you lied to me.

1043
01:05:12,115 --> 01:05:14,049
- I didn't lie to you.
- You did too.

1044
01:05:14,217 --> 01:05:15,548
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

1045
01:05:15,719 --> 01:05:17,380
- I did not.
- You did too.

1046
01:05:17,554 --> 01:05:19,283
- I did not.
- You did too.

1047
01:05:19,456 --> 01:05:22,584
I thought that Fox stuff
was so charming. F-O-X.

1048
01:05:22,759 --> 01:05:24,124
I didn't lie about it.

1049
01:05:25,562 --> 01:05:28,224
- Joe? "Just call me Joe."
- Sure.

1050
01:05:28,498 --> 01:05:31,433
As if you were a stupid
22-year-old girl with no last name.

1051
01:05:31,668 --> 01:05:33,761
"Hi, I'm Kimberly."
"Hi, I'm Janice."

1052
01:05:34,004 --> 01:05:36,165
Don't they know you're
supposed to have a last name?

1053
01:05:36,373 --> 01:05:38,637
It's like an entire
generation of cocktail waitresses.

1054
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:40,071
Look.

1055
01:05:41,878 --> 01:05:45,473
- I am not a 22-year-old cocktail waitress.
- That's not what I meant.

1056
01:05:45,649 --> 01:05:48,140
When I said the thing about
the Price Club and olive oil...

1057
01:05:48,318 --> 01:05:49,478
...that's not what I meant.

1058
01:05:49,653 --> 01:05:53,851
You poor, sad multimillionaire.
I feel so sorry for you.

1059
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:02,831
I'll take a wild guess
that's not him, either.

1060
01:06:04,267 --> 01:06:06,758
So who is he, I wonder?

1061
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:09,461
Certainly not
the world's greatest expert...

1062
01:06:09,706 --> 01:06:11,765
...on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.

1063
01:06:12,442 --> 01:06:14,808
But somebody else entirely different.

1064
01:06:15,545 --> 01:06:17,445
Will you be mean to him too?

1065
01:06:17,714 --> 01:06:19,113
No, I will not.

1066
01:06:19,616 --> 01:06:22,813
The man who is coming here
is completely unlike you.

1067
01:06:23,053 --> 01:06:26,113
The man who is coming here
is kind and funny.

1068
01:06:26,356 --> 01:06:28,620
He's got a wonderful sense of humor.

1069
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:30,121
But...

1070
01:06:30,627 --> 01:06:32,026
...he's not here.

1071
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:35,223
If he's not, he has a reason...

1072
01:06:35,432 --> 01:06:38,560
...because there is not a cruel
or careless bone in his body.

1073
01:06:38,802 --> 01:06:41,032
I wouldn't expect you to understand
anybody like that.

1074
01:06:41,204 --> 01:06:46,141
You with your theme park, multi-level,
homogenize-the-world Mochaccinoland.

1075
01:06:46,376 --> 01:06:50,938
You've deluded yourself that you're a
benefactor bringing books to the masses.

1076
01:06:51,181 --> 01:06:53,809
But no one will ever
remember you, Joe Fox.

1077
01:06:54,084 --> 01:06:56,450
And maybe no one will remember me.

1078
01:06:56,653 --> 01:06:58,712
But plenty of people
remember my mother.

1079
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:00,254
They think she was fine.

1080
01:07:00,457 --> 01:07:03,051
They think her store
was something special.

1081
01:07:04,494 --> 01:07:06,985
You are nothing but a suit.

1082
01:07:20,677 --> 01:07:22,406
That's my cue.

1083
01:07:26,016 --> 01:07:27,540
Good night.

1084
01:08:42,492 --> 01:08:46,451
So then the agent asks

1085
01:08:46,696 --> 01:08:49,290
"If you think I'm even
going to talk to you...

1086
01:08:49,466 --> 01:08:52,264
...about paying that kind
of advance for an author...

1087
01:08:52,469 --> 01:08:56,963
...whose last book is being used
as a trivet all over the world...

1088
01:08:57,207 --> 01:08:59,471
...you are completely crazy."

1089
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:03,873
She was insulting and provocative
and the only thing pleasant about her...

1090
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,345
...was the way her hair
fell across her forehead.

1091
01:09:07,584 --> 01:09:11,452
Underneath that disagreeable
exterior, she may be...

1092
01:09:11,688 --> 01:09:13,588
A real bitch.

1093
01:09:13,823 --> 01:09:14,983
Let's not talk about it.

1094
01:09:15,158 --> 01:09:17,820
I'm going back to the office
and I'm sure you have work to do.

1095
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:19,120
Not really.

1096
01:09:19,296 --> 01:09:22,788
This place is a well-oiled
machine, my friend.

1097
01:09:24,467 --> 01:09:26,697
So? What happened?

1098
01:09:27,237 --> 01:09:30,172
- He never came.
- He stood you up.

1099
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:32,365
I wouldn't characterize it that way.

1100
01:09:32,542 --> 01:09:33,702
I think something happened.

1101
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:37,903
Something unexpected that
made it impossible for him to...

1102
01:09:38,415 --> 01:09:41,384
What if he showed up,
took one look at me and left?

1103
01:09:41,618 --> 01:09:43,483
Not possible.

1104
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:47,121
Maybe there was a subway accident.

1105
01:09:47,490 --> 01:09:48,514
Absolutely.

1106
01:09:48,692 --> 01:09:50,990
A train got trapped underground
with him inside.

1107
01:09:51,161 --> 01:09:52,321
And no phone.

1108
01:09:52,495 --> 01:09:54,759
And you know how those
express trains create suction.

1109
01:09:54,931 --> 01:09:56,762
He got sucked onto the tracks.

1110
01:09:56,933 --> 01:09:57,991
The third rail.

1111
01:09:58,401 --> 01:09:59,993
He's toast.

1112
01:10:00,337 --> 01:10:01,827
What happened?

1113
01:10:02,572 --> 01:10:03,834
He was unable to make it.

1114
01:10:04,574 --> 01:10:05,768
He stood you up?

1115
01:10:08,912 --> 01:10:13,440
Maybe he had a car accident.
Those cab drivers are maniacs.

1116
01:10:13,717 --> 01:10:17,744
They hit something and you slam
into that plastic partition.

1117
01:10:18,021 --> 01:10:21,388
Or his elbows could be in
splints, so he couldn't dial.

1118
01:10:21,658 --> 01:10:23,922
Or he could be unconscious.

1119
01:10:24,094 --> 01:10:25,152
In a coma.

1120
01:10:25,762 --> 01:10:27,593
Stuck in intensive care.

1121
01:10:27,764 --> 01:10:29,425
With a heart monitor beeping.

1122
01:10:29,599 --> 01:10:30,793
And like...

1123
01:10:30,967 --> 01:10:32,161
- No phone.
- No phone.

1124
01:10:35,972 --> 01:10:37,667
What?

1125
01:10:40,944 --> 01:10:42,571
What are you saying?

1126
01:10:42,946 --> 01:10:44,208
It could be.

1127
01:10:44,381 --> 01:10:46,815
He was arrested
two blocks from the caf.

1128
01:10:46,983 --> 01:10:48,678
Is there a picture?

1129
01:10:52,088 --> 01:10:53,885
So that explains it.

1130
01:10:54,391 --> 01:10:55,722
He was in jail.

1131
01:10:55,992 --> 01:10:57,892
And there was a phone.

1132
01:10:58,094 --> 01:11:00,255
He only got one call,
so he called his lawyer.

1133
01:11:00,497 --> 01:11:01,896
You are so lucky.

1134
01:11:02,098 --> 01:11:03,725
You could be dead.

1135
01:11:06,336 --> 01:11:09,066
He couldn't be the Rooftop Killer.

1136
01:11:09,305 --> 01:11:12,604
Remember when you thought
Frank might be the Unabomber?

1137
01:11:12,942 --> 01:11:15,843
Well... That was different.

1138
01:11:16,646 --> 01:11:18,944
How long did you sit there all alone?

1139
01:11:19,215 --> 01:11:22,912
- Not long. Joe Fox came in.
- Joe Fox?

1140
01:11:23,086 --> 01:11:25,452
I don't want to talk about it.
Let's get to work.

1141
01:11:25,655 --> 01:11:28,783
There's got to be something to do.
There's always something to do.

1142
01:11:29,659 --> 01:11:32,025
- Look at this.
- He looks kind of cute.

1143
01:11:35,165 --> 01:11:36,359
So?

1144
01:11:36,533 --> 01:11:39,161
He was unavoidably detained.

1145
01:11:39,602 --> 01:11:41,729
He stood you up?

1146
01:11:45,842 --> 01:11:48,106
<i>I've been thinking about you.</i>

1147
01:11:49,012 --> 01:11:52,504
<i>Last night I went to meet you,
and you weren't there.</i>

1148
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:57,845
<i>I wish I knew why.
I felt so foolish.</i>

1149
01:11:59,756 --> 01:12:01,656
<i>And as I waited,
someone else showed up.</i>

1150
01:12:01,825 --> 01:12:05,056
<i>A man who has made
my professional life a misery.</i>

1151
01:12:05,328 --> 01:12:07,762
<i>And an amazing thing happened.</i>

1152
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,861
<i>I was able, for the first time...</i>

1153
01:12:12,135 --> 01:12:14,262
<i>... to say the exact thing
I wanted to say...</i>

1154
01:12:14,504 --> 01:12:17,405
<i>... at the exact moment
I wanted to say it.</i>

1155
01:12:17,874 --> 01:12:21,674
<i>And of course,
afterwards I felt terrible...</i>

1156
01:12:22,045 --> 01:12:24,275
<i>... just as you said I would.</i>

1157
01:12:25,281 --> 01:12:28,011
<i>I was cruel, and I'm never cruel.</i>

1158
01:12:28,852 --> 01:12:31,878
<i>Though I hardly believe
what I said mattered to this man.</i>

1159
01:12:32,055 --> 01:12:35,149
<i>To him, I am just a bug to be crushed.</i>

1160
01:12:35,892 --> 01:12:37,154
<i>But what if it did?</i>

1161
01:12:37,393 --> 01:12:41,386
<i>No matter what he's done to me,
there is no excuse for my behavior.</i>

1162
01:12:42,098 --> 01:12:43,497
<i>Anyway...</i>

1163
01:12:43,733 --> 01:12:46,167
<i>... I so wanted to talk to you.</i>

1164
01:12:46,903 --> 01:12:49,531
<i>I hope you have a good reason
for not being there last night.</i>

1165
01:12:49,706 --> 01:12:53,608
<i>You don't seem like the kind of
person who'd do something like that.</i>

1166
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:56,337
<i>The odd thing about this
form of communication...</i>

1167
01:12:56,513 --> 01:12:59,380
<i>... is that you're more likely to talk
about nothing than something.</i>

1168
01:12:59,549 --> 01:13:01,107
<i>But I just want to say...</i>

1169
01:13:01,351 --> 01:13:04,946
<i>... that all this nothing has meant
more to me than so many...</i>

1170
01:13:05,188 --> 01:13:06,815
<i>... somethings.</i>

1171
01:13:08,124 --> 01:13:09,921
<i>So thanks.</i>

1172
01:13:26,409 --> 01:13:27,774
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1173
01:14:21,598 --> 01:14:23,293
<i>I am in...</i>

1174
01:14:26,703 --> 01:14:28,432
<i>... Vancouver.</i>

1175
01:14:38,014 --> 01:14:41,177
<i>I was stuck in a meeting
which I couldn't get out of...</i>

1176
01:14:41,417 --> 01:14:42,611
<i>... and...</i>

1177
01:14:42,952 --> 01:14:44,715
<i>... the electricity went out.</i>

1178
01:14:44,988 --> 01:14:46,478
<i>And...</i>

1179
01:14:46,656 --> 01:14:47,953
<i>... we were trapped...</i>

1180
01:14:48,124 --> 01:14:50,319
<i>... on the 38th floor.</i>

1181
01:14:51,995 --> 01:14:54,486
<i>And the telephone system blew too.</i>

1182
01:15:01,671 --> 01:15:03,502
<i>Amazingly enough.</i>

1183
01:15:38,608 --> 01:15:40,371
<i>Dear friend:</i>

1184
01:15:43,379 --> 01:15:46,280
<i>I cannot tell you
what happened last night.</i>

1185
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:50,041
<i>But I beg you
from the bottom of my heart...</i>

1186
01:15:50,219 --> 01:15:52,346
<i>... to forgive me for not being there.</i>

1187
01:16:00,797 --> 01:16:02,389
<i>For what happened.</i>

1188
01:16:05,034 --> 01:16:08,595
<i>I feel terrible that you
found yourself in a situation...</i>

1189
01:16:08,771 --> 01:16:11,638
<i>... that caused you additional pain.</i>

1190
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:15,878
<i>But I'm absolutely sure...</i>

1191
01:16:16,212 --> 01:16:19,739
<i>... that whatever you said
last night was provoked.</i>

1192
01:16:20,016 --> 01:16:21,643
<i>Even deserved.</i>

1193
01:16:25,154 --> 01:16:29,420
<i>Everyone says things they regret
when they're worried or stressed.</i>

1194
01:16:31,461 --> 01:16:34,828
<i>You were expecting to see
someone you trusted...</i>

1195
01:16:35,064 --> 01:16:37,464
<i>... and met the enemy instead.</i>

1196
01:16:41,104 --> 01:16:42,969
<i>The fault is mine.</i>

1197
01:16:45,475 --> 01:16:48,137
<i>Someday I'll explain everything.</i>

1198
01:16:48,678 --> 01:16:49,975
<i>Meanwhile...</i>

1199
01:16:50,146 --> 01:16:51,579
<i>... I'm still here.</i>

1200
01:16:52,582 --> 01:16:53,776
<i>Talk to me.</i>

1201
01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:56,783
Did he say anything about
wanting to meet you again?

1202
01:16:56,953 --> 01:16:58,477
No, not really.

1203
01:16:59,088 --> 01:17:00,578
Listen, it doesn't matter.

1204
01:17:00,757 --> 01:17:03,590
We'll just be like George Bernard
Shaw and Mrs. Patrick Campbell.

1205
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:04,954
We'll write letters our whole lives.

1206
01:17:06,763 --> 01:17:09,493
Thank you for the scones.
They look lovely.

1207
01:17:09,766 --> 01:17:13,065
Birdie, where was this one taken?

1208
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:14,697
Seville.

1209
01:17:14,871 --> 01:17:17,169
- When you fell madly in love?
- Yes.

1210
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:20,807
So, dearie,
what have you decided to do?

1211
01:17:21,077 --> 01:17:23,568
Close. We're going to close.

1212
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:25,438
Close.

1213
01:17:26,182 --> 01:17:30,516
Closing the store is
the brave thing to do.

1214
01:17:31,287 --> 01:17:33,881
You are such a liar.
But thank you.

1215
01:17:35,224 --> 01:17:40,287
You are daring to imagine that
you could have a different life.

1216
01:17:41,097 --> 01:17:46,000
I know it doesn't feel like that.
You feel like a big, fat failure now.

1217
01:17:46,235 --> 01:17:47,395
But you're not.

1218
01:17:47,804 --> 01:17:51,900
You are marching into
the unknown, armed with...

1219
01:17:52,108 --> 01:17:53,132
...nothing.

1220
01:17:53,843 --> 01:17:55,538
Have a sandwich.

1221
01:17:56,679 --> 01:18:00,080
Not nothing.
I have a little money saved.

1222
01:18:00,249 --> 01:18:04,117
If you need more, ask me.
I'm very rich.

1223
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:07,118
I bought Intel at six.

1224
01:18:10,493 --> 01:18:13,189
I suppose you want me
to tell you who it was...

1225
01:18:13,429 --> 01:18:15,761
...I fell madly in love with.

1226
01:18:16,566 --> 01:18:17,931
But I'm not going to tell.

1227
01:18:18,835 --> 01:18:20,166
Who was it, Birdie?

1228
01:18:21,137 --> 01:18:24,072
Come on, tell. Uch. That's so mean.

1229
01:18:25,241 --> 01:18:26,538
But so romantic.

1230
01:18:26,709 --> 01:18:29,143
- It wasn't meant to be.
- Why not?

1231
01:18:30,279 --> 01:18:31,837
He ran Spain.

1232
01:18:33,082 --> 01:18:34,447
Spain?

1233
01:18:34,684 --> 01:18:37,209
The country, he ran it.
It was his job.

1234
01:18:37,453 --> 01:18:39,216
And then he died.

1235
01:18:39,455 --> 01:18:41,082
Just as well.

1236
01:18:41,424 --> 01:18:42,857
Milk or lemon?

1237
01:18:44,393 --> 01:18:47,521
She fell in love with
Generalissimo Franco.

1238
01:18:47,697 --> 01:18:49,756
Don't say that.
We don't know that for sure.

1239
01:18:49,932 --> 01:18:53,026
Who else could it have been?
It was around 1960.

1240
01:18:53,202 --> 01:18:55,796
- Do you want some popcorn?
- I can't believe this.

1241
01:18:57,039 --> 01:19:01,601
It's not like he was something normal,
like a socialist or an anarchist.

1242
01:19:01,878 --> 01:19:03,470
It happened in Spain.

1243
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,977
People do stupid things
in foreign countries.

1244
01:19:06,182 --> 01:19:09,208
They buy leather jackets
for much more than they're worth.

1245
01:19:09,452 --> 01:19:12,751
But they don't fall in love
with fascist dictators.

1246
01:19:18,895 --> 01:19:21,762
Birdie is a very special person to me.

1247
01:19:21,998 --> 01:19:24,694
She is practically my surrogate mother.

1248
01:19:24,901 --> 01:19:26,334
She's out of her mind.

1249
01:19:26,502 --> 01:19:27,560
She is not.

1250
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:32,100
I could never be with anybody who
doesn't take politics as seriously as I do.

1251
01:19:32,308 --> 01:19:33,434
Do you mind?

1252
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:35,110
A hot dog is singing.

1253
01:19:35,344 --> 01:19:38,404
You need quiet
while a hot dog is singing?

1254
01:19:41,817 --> 01:19:44,251
I have something to tell you, Frank.

1255
01:19:45,354 --> 01:19:47,652
- I didn't vote.
- What?

1256
01:19:47,823 --> 01:19:49,654
In the last mayoral election...

1257
01:19:49,825 --> 01:19:52,817
...when Rudy Giuliani was running
against Ruth Messinger...

1258
01:19:53,095 --> 01:19:54,824
...I went to get a manicure.

1259
01:19:55,031 --> 01:19:57,090
And forgot to vote.

1260
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:58,933
Since when do you get manicures?

1261
01:19:59,101 --> 01:20:02,161
I suppose you could never be with
a woman who got manicures?

1262
01:20:03,306 --> 01:20:05,774
It's okay. I forgive you.

1263
01:20:06,842 --> 01:20:07,866
You forgive me?

1264
01:20:17,186 --> 01:20:19,814
Excuse me, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

1265
01:20:20,890 --> 01:20:23,017
This has been a big week.
You're closing the store.

1266
01:20:23,192 --> 01:20:26,457
No, it's not that.
Really, it's not.

1267
01:20:26,696 --> 01:20:29,665
I know, I know.
That was terrible of me.

1268
01:20:31,133 --> 01:20:32,327
What was terrible?

1269
01:20:32,501 --> 01:20:35,265
Jumping all over you
when I'm the one...

1270
01:20:36,772 --> 01:20:39,206
I don't even know how to say this.

1271
01:20:40,376 --> 01:20:41,673
What is it?

1272
01:20:42,712 --> 01:20:43,770
What?

1273
01:20:45,414 --> 01:20:47,780
You're a wonderful person.

1274
01:20:48,284 --> 01:20:49,911
So are you.

1275
01:20:50,152 --> 01:20:54,316
And I'm so honored that
you'd want to be with me...

1276
01:20:54,490 --> 01:20:58,586
...because you wouldn't be with
anyone who wasn't truly worthy.

1277
01:20:58,794 --> 01:21:01,524
- I feel exactly the same way.
- No, God, don't...

1278
01:21:01,998 --> 01:21:05,331
Don't say that.
That makes it worse.

1279
01:21:05,601 --> 01:21:07,000
What?

1280
01:21:08,537 --> 01:21:09,731
You don't love me.

1281
01:21:17,046 --> 01:21:18,513
Me either.

1282
01:21:18,914 --> 01:21:20,814
You don't love me?

1283
01:21:22,385 --> 01:21:23,443
No.

1284
01:21:23,819 --> 01:21:25,684
But we're so right for each other.

1285
01:21:25,921 --> 01:21:29,049
I know. I know.

1286
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,126
Well, is there someone else?

1287
01:21:33,462 --> 01:21:36,693
That woman on television, Sidney Ann.

1288
01:21:37,566 --> 01:21:40,433
Nothing has happened, but...

1289
01:21:41,837 --> 01:21:43,532
Is she a Republican?

1290
01:21:43,739 --> 01:21:46,264
I can't help myself.

1291
01:21:55,451 --> 01:21:58,909
What about you?
Is there someone else?

1292
01:22:00,122 --> 01:22:01,589
No.

1293
01:22:02,591 --> 01:22:04,286
No, but...

1294
01:22:06,262 --> 01:22:09,390
But there is the dream
of someone else.

1295
01:22:36,392 --> 01:22:39,020
<i>Grab a copy of
The Trumpet of the Swan.</i>

1296
01:22:39,295 --> 01:22:40,819
This is a tragedy.

1297
01:22:42,598 --> 01:22:45,260
- These chairs for sale?
- Anything not nailed down.

1298
01:22:45,468 --> 01:22:46,901
Ten dollars, it's yours.

1299
01:22:47,103 --> 01:22:48,661
What are you going to do now?

1300
01:22:48,838 --> 01:22:52,501
I don't know. I think I'll take some time.
I'm almost looking forward to it.

1301
01:22:52,775 --> 01:22:53,799
Good luck to you.

1302
01:22:56,178 --> 01:22:59,204
I came here every Saturday
when I was a little girl.

1303
01:22:59,448 --> 01:23:02,611
<i>I remember when your mother
gave me Anne of Green Gables.</i>

1304
01:23:02,852 --> 01:23:05,320
"Read it with a box of Kleenex"...

1305
01:23:05,488 --> 01:23:06,785
...she told me.

1306
01:23:06,956 --> 01:23:07,980
Could someone help me?

1307
01:23:08,157 --> 01:23:09,818
She's looking down on you now.

1308
01:23:09,992 --> 01:23:11,289
I'm sure she is.

1309
01:23:11,527 --> 01:23:14,189
Why don't we bomb Fox Books?

1310
01:25:03,305 --> 01:25:05,102
Do you have the "shoe" books?

1311
01:25:05,941 --> 01:25:07,272
The shoe books?

1312
01:25:07,743 --> 01:25:08,801
Who's the author?

1313
01:25:08,978 --> 01:25:10,070
I don't know.

1314
01:25:10,246 --> 01:25:14,808
My friend told me my daughter has to
read the shoe books, so here I am.

1315
01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:16,415
Noel Streatfeild.

1316
01:25:19,188 --> 01:25:22,089
<i>Noel Streatfeild wrote
Ballet Shoes and Skating Shoes...</i>

1317
01:25:22,324 --> 01:25:23,348
<i>...and Theatre Shoes...</i>

1318
01:25:23,626 --> 01:25:25,321
<i>...and Dancing Shoes and...</i>

1319
01:25:25,594 --> 01:25:28,324
<i>I'd start with Ballet Shoes first.
It's my favorite.</i>

1320
01:25:29,365 --> 01:25:32,698
<i>Although Skating Shoes
is completely wonderful.</i>

1321
01:25:33,936 --> 01:25:35,301
But it's out of print.

1322
01:25:36,205 --> 01:25:39,572
Streatfeild.
How do you spell that?

1323
01:25:41,377 --> 01:25:46,713
S-T-R-E-A-T-F-E-l-L-D.

1324
01:25:47,716 --> 01:25:48,944
Thank you.

1325
01:25:49,818 --> 01:25:52,981
<i>Kathleen Kelly.
It was like her name was in the air.</i>

1326
01:25:53,155 --> 01:25:54,179
Just like that?

1327
01:25:54,356 --> 01:25:56,381
Everyone was talking about her today.

1328
01:25:56,592 --> 01:25:59,083
Kathleen Kelly and her "situation."

1329
01:25:59,328 --> 01:26:03,890
And I was thinking that she'd make
a great children's book editor.

1330
01:26:04,199 --> 01:26:05,689
What makes you think that?

1331
01:26:05,968 --> 01:26:08,596
Well, she knows everything.

1332
01:26:08,837 --> 01:26:11,738
She has flawless taste.
She's famous for it.

1333
01:26:12,007 --> 01:26:16,410
Salesmen swear by her.
If she likes the book, it sells. Period.

1334
01:26:16,645 --> 01:26:18,408
You're going to offer her a job?

1335
01:26:18,647 --> 01:26:20,672
What else has she got to do?

1336
01:26:20,916 --> 01:26:23,680
- Now that she's destitute.
- Thanks to you.

1337
01:26:23,919 --> 01:26:26,615
- I don't see her working for you.
- Why not?

1338
01:26:26,855 --> 01:26:28,516
She lacks the killer instinct.

1339
01:26:28,724 --> 01:26:30,885
She's never fired anybody.
Look at that little shop.

1340
01:26:31,126 --> 01:26:33,356
Those people have been there forever.

1341
01:26:33,562 --> 01:26:35,621
Till recently, when they all
lost their jobs.

1342
01:26:35,831 --> 01:26:37,264
Thanks to you.

1343
01:26:38,033 --> 01:26:39,898
Hold the elevator!

1344
01:26:40,936 --> 01:26:43,734
Missy. Mr. Fox.

1345
01:26:44,039 --> 01:26:45,506
Hello, Charlie.

1346
01:26:46,675 --> 01:26:50,873
I love how you've forgotten you had
any role in her current situation.

1347
01:26:51,146 --> 01:26:52,374
It's so obtuse.

1348
01:26:52,881 --> 01:26:54,849
It's so insensitive.

1349
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:56,540
Reminds me of someone.

1350
01:26:56,719 --> 01:26:58,710
Who does it remind me of?

1351
01:27:00,289 --> 01:27:01,586
Me.

1352
01:27:06,528 --> 01:27:07,552
What is going on?

1353
01:27:08,097 --> 01:27:09,189
Could be stuck.

1354
01:27:16,905 --> 01:27:18,065
What are you doing?

1355
01:27:19,475 --> 01:27:21,909
I hope this thing doesn't
plummet to the basement.

1356
01:27:22,311 --> 01:27:24,279
- Can it do that?
- No.

1357
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:26,980
It cannot plummet to the basement.

1358
01:27:28,083 --> 01:27:31,177
Hi, this is Joe Fox. Who's this?
Juan?

1359
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:35,454
We are stuck in the elevator
between the sixth and seventh floor.

1360
01:27:35,624 --> 01:27:36,716
There's four of us.

1361
01:27:36,892 --> 01:27:39,793
And if you don't get your ass
up here in two shakes...

1362
01:27:40,062 --> 01:27:41,927
...and get us the hell out of here...!

1363
01:27:42,097 --> 01:27:43,962
Juan? Yeah.

1364
01:27:44,133 --> 01:27:45,225
Listen.

1365
01:27:45,401 --> 01:27:47,801
Call the super and then 9-1-1.

1366
01:27:48,737 --> 01:27:50,762
9-1-1.

1367
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:53,640
The fire department, that's right.

1368
01:27:55,077 --> 01:27:56,806
Thank you very much.

1369
01:27:59,748 --> 01:28:02,114
- Everyone should jump in the air.
- What?

1370
01:28:02,951 --> 01:28:04,111
We jump.

1371
01:28:04,286 --> 01:28:06,948
The elevator thinks no one
is here and it opens.

1372
01:28:11,593 --> 01:28:15,654
One, two, three. Jump!

1373
01:28:22,805 --> 01:28:25,000
If I ever get out of here...

1374
01:28:25,307 --> 01:28:27,832
...I'm going to start speaking
to my mama.

1375
01:28:29,178 --> 01:28:31,738
Wonder what she's doing
right this very minute?

1376
01:28:32,481 --> 01:28:34,176
If I ever get out of here...

1377
01:28:35,017 --> 01:28:36,814
...I'm marrying Orit.

1378
01:28:37,519 --> 01:28:39,043
I love her.

1379
01:28:39,388 --> 01:28:42,653
I should marry her.
I don't know what's been stopping me.

1380
01:28:49,631 --> 01:28:53,260
If I ever get out of here,
I'm having my eyes lasered.

1381
01:28:59,775 --> 01:29:01,504
If I ever get out of here...

1382
01:29:01,677 --> 01:29:04,305
Where are my Tic-Tacs?

1383
01:29:06,882 --> 01:29:08,315
What?

1384
01:29:11,086 --> 01:29:15,147
<i>I came home tonight and got into
the elevator to go to my apartment.</i>

1385
01:29:15,357 --> 01:29:18,190
<i>An hour later,
I got out of the elevator...</i>

1386
01:29:18,427 --> 01:29:20,657
<i>... and Brinkley and I moved out.</i>

1387
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:23,660
<i>Suddenly everything had become clear.</i>

1388
01:29:24,066 --> 01:29:25,533
<i>It's a long story...</i>

1389
01:29:25,934 --> 01:29:28,801
<i>... full of the personal details
we avoid so carefully.</i>

1390
01:29:29,037 --> 01:29:30,595
<i>Let me just say...</i>

1391
01:29:31,006 --> 01:29:33,736
<i>... there was a man sitting
in the elevator with me...</i>

1392
01:29:33,909 --> 01:29:36,537
<i>... who knew exactly what he wanted.</i>

1393
01:29:37,112 --> 01:29:40,809
<i>And I found myself wishing
I were as lucky as he.</i>

1394
01:29:44,253 --> 01:29:47,950
<i>People are always telling you
that change is a good thing.</i>

1395
01:29:48,190 --> 01:29:51,853
<i>But all they're saying is that something
you didn't want to happen at all...</i>

1396
01:29:52,394 --> 01:29:53,918
<i>... has happened.</i>

1397
01:29:55,097 --> 01:29:57,463
<i>My store is closing this week.</i>

1398
01:29:57,833 --> 01:30:01,394
<i>I own a store.
Did I ever tell you that?</i>

1399
01:30:01,970 --> 01:30:03,835
<i>It's a lovely store.</i>

1400
01:30:04,039 --> 01:30:06,633
<i>In a week it will be
something depressing...</i>

1401
01:30:06,875 --> 01:30:08,536
<i>... like a Baby Gap.</i>

1402
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:13,211
<i>Soon we'll just be a memory.</i>

1403
01:30:13,415 --> 01:30:17,977
<i>In fact, some foolish person will
probably think it's a tribute to this city.</i>

1404
01:30:18,253 --> 01:30:22,952
<i>The way it keeps changing on you,
or the way you can never count on it.</i>

1405
01:30:23,425 --> 01:30:25,484
<i>I know because that's
the sort of thing I'd say.</i>

1406
01:30:25,727 --> 01:30:27,558
<i>But the truth is...</i>

1407
01:30:28,797 --> 01:30:30,662
<i>... I'm heartbroken.</i>

1408
01:30:33,068 --> 01:30:35,662
<i>I feel as if a part of me has died...</i>

1409
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:38,805
<i>... and my mother has died
all over again.</i>

1410
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:44,438
<i>And no one can ever make it right.</i>

1411
01:32:49,204 --> 01:32:50,535
What happened?

1412
01:32:52,941 --> 01:32:54,408
Oh, hell.

1413
01:32:56,244 --> 01:32:57,268
How are you?

1414
01:32:57,446 --> 01:33:00,574
You know, Dad, you did pretty well.
At least you didn't marry her.

1415
01:33:00,782 --> 01:33:02,409
Welcome aboard.

1416
01:33:03,018 --> 01:33:05,885
- It lasted a while.
- Yeah.

1417
01:33:20,535 --> 01:33:22,059
You know...

1418
01:33:23,038 --> 01:33:25,063
...I've stayed on this boat after...

1419
01:33:25,941 --> 01:33:27,340
Let's see.

1420
01:33:27,542 --> 01:33:28,839
Your mother.

1421
01:33:30,245 --> 01:33:31,940
Laurette, the ballet dancer.

1422
01:33:32,114 --> 01:33:33,138
My nanny.

1423
01:33:34,049 --> 01:33:35,311
She was the nanny?

1424
01:33:35,917 --> 01:33:37,407
Yeah.

1425
01:33:37,853 --> 01:33:39,411
I forgot that.

1426
01:33:39,788 --> 01:33:41,449
How ironic.

1427
01:33:41,923 --> 01:33:43,948
Then there was the ice skater.

1428
01:33:44,192 --> 01:33:46,285
- Also my nanny.
- Really?

1429
01:33:46,661 --> 01:33:47,923
Yeah.

1430
01:33:48,130 --> 01:33:50,758
That's amazingly ironic.

1431
01:33:51,299 --> 01:33:53,631
And then there was Sybil, the, um...

1432
01:33:54,302 --> 01:33:56,270
- It's an "A" word.
- Astrologer.

1433
01:33:56,805 --> 01:33:58,204
Exactly.

1434
01:33:58,774 --> 01:34:01,766
Whose moon turned out to be
in someone else's house.

1435
01:34:02,644 --> 01:34:04,578
Just like Gillian.

1436
01:34:05,313 --> 01:34:07,611
- Gillian ran off with someone?
- The nanny.

1437
01:34:08,450 --> 01:34:10,179
- Nanny Maureen?
- Yes.

1438
01:34:14,122 --> 01:34:16,488
Gillian ran off with Nanny Maureen.

1439
01:34:17,159 --> 01:34:18,649
You got it.

1440
01:34:18,827 --> 01:34:20,795
It's incredibly ironic.

1441
01:34:21,096 --> 01:34:24,088
- That's true.
- No other word for it.

1442
01:34:24,499 --> 01:34:26,467
Well, who's better than us?

1443
01:34:27,035 --> 01:34:29,128
Father and son, together at last.

1444
01:34:29,604 --> 01:34:31,367
Who did you say you broke up with?

1445
01:34:32,007 --> 01:34:33,531
Patricia.

1446
01:34:33,975 --> 01:34:35,306
You met her.

1447
01:34:35,477 --> 01:34:37,206
Would I like her?

1448
01:34:39,047 --> 01:34:40,639
Just kidding, son.

1449
01:34:41,917 --> 01:34:44,147
Now, is this beautiful or what?

1450
01:34:45,353 --> 01:34:48,982
Of course, I'll be living out of
a suitcase for at least three weeks.

1451
01:34:49,558 --> 01:34:52,994
And then there's
the inevitable legal hassle.

1452
01:34:53,228 --> 01:34:54,991
More of your inheritance
down the drain.

1453
01:34:55,163 --> 01:34:57,654
- Don't worry about it.
- I won't.

1454
01:34:57,999 --> 01:35:01,264
I just have to meet someone new.
That's the easy part.

1455
01:35:01,636 --> 01:35:02,728
Right, yeah.

1456
01:35:02,904 --> 01:35:06,840
A snap to find the one person in the
world who fills your heart with joy.

1457
01:35:07,075 --> 01:35:08,702
Don't be ridiculous.

1458
01:35:08,944 --> 01:35:11,708
Have I ever been with anybody
who fit that description?

1459
01:35:12,581 --> 01:35:14,276
Have you?

1460
01:35:41,610 --> 01:35:43,407
<i>Who is it?</i>

1461
01:35:44,479 --> 01:35:46,413
It's Joe Fox.

1462
01:35:48,250 --> 01:35:49,945
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

1463
01:35:51,219 --> 01:35:54,711
<i>- May I please come up?
- No, I don't...</i>

1464
01:35:54,956 --> 01:35:58,255
<i>No, I don't really think that
that is a good idea, because...</i>

1465
01:35:58,460 --> 01:35:59,984
<i>... I have a...</i>

1466
01:36:00,395 --> 01:36:01,885
I have a terrible...

1467
01:36:02,130 --> 01:36:03,495
...cold.

1468
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:10,837
- Can you hear that?
- Yeah.

1469
01:36:11,006 --> 01:36:14,203
<i>I'm sniffling,
and I'm not really awake.</i>

1470
01:36:14,442 --> 01:36:18,344
<i>I'm taking echinacea and vitamin C
and sleeping practically...</i>

1471
01:36:18,613 --> 01:36:21,013
...24 hours a day.
I have a temperature.

1472
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:25,347
<i>And I think I'm contagious.
So I would...</i>

1473
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:27,850
I would really appreciate it
if you'd just go away.

1474
01:36:32,661 --> 01:36:33,719
Kathleen?

1475
01:36:39,834 --> 01:36:42,302
Just a second!

1476
01:36:49,144 --> 01:36:51,738
Yes, just a second.

1477
01:37:02,524 --> 01:37:03,616
- Hello.
- Hello.

1478
01:37:04,492 --> 01:37:05,891
What are you doing here?

1479
01:37:06,328 --> 01:37:07,886
I heard you were sick.

1480
01:37:08,129 --> 01:37:09,653
And I was worried.

1481
01:37:11,333 --> 01:37:14,166
And I wanted to make sure...

1482
01:37:14,369 --> 01:37:15,495
What?

1483
01:37:15,904 --> 01:37:17,735
- Is there somebody here?
- No.

1484
01:37:17,906 --> 01:37:20,704
It's the Home Shopping Network.

1485
01:37:20,976 --> 01:37:23,171
You buy any of those
little porcelain dolls?

1486
01:37:23,411 --> 01:37:25,174
I was thinking about it.

1487
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:28,405
- You put me out of business.
- Yes, I did.

1488
01:37:28,683 --> 01:37:30,275
- Did you come to gloat?
- No.

1489
01:37:30,552 --> 01:37:32,417
- To offer me a job?
- I would never...

1490
01:37:32,687 --> 01:37:35,986
I have plenty of offers.
I got offered a job by...

1491
01:37:36,224 --> 01:37:38,317
- By my former...
- Your former?

1492
01:37:39,194 --> 01:37:40,218
We broke up.

1493
01:37:40,428 --> 01:37:43,829
That's too bad.
You were so perfect for each other.

1494
01:37:47,035 --> 01:37:49,902
I don't mean to say things like that.
No matter what you've done...

1495
01:37:50,171 --> 01:37:52,435
...there's no excuse
for my saying that.

1496
01:37:52,607 --> 01:37:53,835
Every time I see you...

1497
01:37:54,009 --> 01:37:56,239
Things like that just
fly out of your mouth.

1498
01:37:58,813 --> 01:38:00,007
I brought you flowers.

1499
01:38:03,718 --> 01:38:04,742
Thank you.

1500
01:38:10,191 --> 01:38:12,455
Why don't I just put these
in some water?

1501
01:38:13,928 --> 01:38:15,828
You're sick.
You should sit down.

1502
01:38:21,703 --> 01:38:23,136
I need a vase.

1503
01:38:24,139 --> 01:38:26,107
Above the refrigerator.

1504
01:38:26,641 --> 01:38:29,041
There it is. Obviously.

1505
01:38:30,211 --> 01:38:32,941
George says hello, by the way.

1506
01:38:34,749 --> 01:38:36,216
He told me you were sick.

1507
01:38:36,551 --> 01:38:37,984
How is George?

1508
01:38:39,487 --> 01:38:41,387
Great, really great.

1509
01:38:41,756 --> 01:38:44,122
He's revolutionizing the place.

1510
01:38:44,359 --> 01:38:45,792
You can't work in his department...

1511
01:38:46,061 --> 01:38:48,655
...unless you have a Ph.D.
In Children's Literature.

1512
01:38:48,963 --> 01:38:50,555
I love daisies.

1513
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:54,234
- You told me.
- They're so friendly.

1514
01:38:54,602 --> 01:38:57,901
Don't you think daisies
are the friendliest flower?

1515
01:38:58,073 --> 01:38:59,097
I do.

1516
01:39:00,308 --> 01:39:01,400
When did you break up?

1517
01:39:02,744 --> 01:39:03,904
Couple of weeks ago.

1518
01:39:04,746 --> 01:39:07,408
Everyone is breaking up.
You. Me.

1519
01:39:07,615 --> 01:39:11,142
This other person I know broke up
with someone in an elevator.

1520
01:39:11,386 --> 01:39:14,116
Or after it, or just outside it or...

1521
01:39:14,389 --> 01:39:16,118
It got stuck.

1522
01:39:16,658 --> 01:39:20,025
When I saw you at the coffee place,
I was waiting for him.

1523
01:39:20,295 --> 01:39:21,592
And I was...

1524
01:39:21,796 --> 01:39:23,093
Charming.

1525
01:39:23,665 --> 01:39:25,155
I was not charming.

1526
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:27,095
You looked charming. Tea?

1527
01:39:27,302 --> 01:39:28,826
Yes. I was...

1528
01:39:29,003 --> 01:39:31,699
I was upset and horrible.

1529
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:34,035
- Honey?
- Yes.

1530
01:39:34,209 --> 01:39:35,506
I was the horrible one.

1531
01:39:35,710 --> 01:39:37,302
Well, that's true.

1532
01:39:37,545 --> 01:39:40,013
But I have no excuse.

1533
01:39:40,648 --> 01:39:42,809
I see what you're saying.

1534
01:39:43,818 --> 01:39:45,012
That's interesting.

1535
01:39:45,286 --> 01:39:47,277
Whereas I am a horrible person...

1536
01:39:47,489 --> 01:39:51,050
...therefore I have no choice
but to be horrible.

1537
01:39:51,326 --> 01:39:54,420
That's what you're saying.
But that's all right.

1538
01:39:54,629 --> 01:39:57,291
I put you out of business so...

1539
01:39:57,932 --> 01:39:59,456
...you're entitled to hate me.

1540
01:40:00,935 --> 01:40:02,459
I don't hate you.

1541
01:40:03,438 --> 01:40:05,633
But you'll never forgive me.

1542
01:40:06,007 --> 01:40:08,168
- Just like Elizabeth.
- Who?

1543
01:40:08,843 --> 01:40:11,073
<i>Elizabeth Bennet in
Pride and Prejudice.</i>

1544
01:40:11,312 --> 01:40:12,336
She was too proud.

1545
01:40:12,547 --> 01:40:14,981
<i>I thought you hated
Pride and Prejudice.</i>

1546
01:40:15,216 --> 01:40:17,707
Or was she too prejudiced...

1547
01:40:17,986 --> 01:40:20,454
...and Mr. Darcy is too proud?

1548
01:40:20,688 --> 01:40:22,053
I can't remember.

1549
01:40:28,663 --> 01:40:30,221
It wasn't personal.

1550
01:40:30,532 --> 01:40:33,865
What is that supposed to mean?
I'm so sick of that.

1551
01:40:34,102 --> 01:40:37,469
All that means is that
it wasn't personal to you.

1552
01:40:37,705 --> 01:40:39,468
But it was personal to me.

1553
01:40:39,707 --> 01:40:41,971
It's personal to a lot of people.

1554
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:45,236
What is so wrong
with being personal anyway?

1555
01:40:46,414 --> 01:40:47,745
Nothing.

1556
01:40:48,016 --> 01:40:52,112
Whatever else anything is,
it ought to begin by being personal.

1557
01:40:55,490 --> 01:40:57,890
My head is starting to get fuzzy.

1558
01:41:03,264 --> 01:41:05,198
Why did you stop by again?
I forget.

1559
01:41:06,734 --> 01:41:07,996
I wanted to be your friend.

1560
01:41:11,406 --> 01:41:13,533
I knew it wasn't possible.

1561
01:41:14,642 --> 01:41:17,702
Sometimes a guy
just wants the impossible.

1562
01:41:27,655 --> 01:41:29,555
Can I ask you a question?

1563
01:41:29,757 --> 01:41:30,951
What?

1564
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:35,456
What happened with that guy
at the caf?

1565
01:41:36,331 --> 01:41:37,457
Nothing.

1566
01:41:37,665 --> 01:41:39,530
But you're crazy about him?

1567
01:41:40,902 --> 01:41:41,926
Yes, I am.

1568
01:41:42,103 --> 01:41:45,539
Why don't you run off with him?
What are you waiting for?

1569
01:41:47,942 --> 01:41:49,910
I don't actually know him.

1570
01:41:50,478 --> 01:41:51,536
Really?

1571
01:41:54,115 --> 01:41:56,777
I only know him through...

1572
01:41:57,619 --> 01:41:59,086
You won't believe this.

1573
01:41:59,254 --> 01:42:00,915
Let me guess.

1574
01:42:01,456 --> 01:42:02,821
Through the Internet?

1575
01:42:04,292 --> 01:42:05,850
Yes.

1576
01:42:09,063 --> 01:42:11,531
"You've got mail."

1577
01:42:11,699 --> 01:42:13,166
Yes.

1578
01:42:15,503 --> 01:42:16,868
Those are very powerful words.

1579
01:42:17,505 --> 01:42:18,995
Yes.

1580
01:42:22,076 --> 01:42:23,839
I'm happy for him.

1581
01:42:25,213 --> 01:42:26,942
Although...

1582
01:42:28,283 --> 01:42:30,217
Could I just make a suggestion?

1583
01:42:30,852 --> 01:42:32,183
What?

1584
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:34,087
I think...

1585
01:42:34,622 --> 01:42:36,317
...you should meet him.

1586
01:42:36,824 --> 01:42:39,292
No, wait, I take that back.

1587
01:42:40,228 --> 01:42:43,095
Why would you meet
somebody you're crazy about?

1588
01:42:43,331 --> 01:42:47,028
I hardly think I need to take
advice from a person who...

1589
01:42:49,404 --> 01:42:51,599
I can see I bring out
the worst in you.

1590
01:42:51,839 --> 01:42:54,467
Let me help you
to not say something...

1591
01:42:54,709 --> 01:42:59,169
...you'll torture yourself about
for years to come.

1592
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:14,555
I hope you feel better soon.

1593
01:43:15,897 --> 01:43:18,195
It'd be a shame to miss
New York in the spring.

1594
01:43:22,437 --> 01:43:23,995
Thank you for the daisies.

1595
01:43:35,083 --> 01:43:37,711
Well, you take care.

1596
01:43:39,153 --> 01:43:40,177
I will.

1597
01:43:41,422 --> 01:43:42,514
Goodbye.

1598
01:43:44,392 --> 01:43:45,757
Goodbye.

1599
01:44:02,777 --> 01:44:04,972
<i>I've been thinking about this...</i>

1600
01:44:05,213 --> 01:44:07,306
<i>... and I think we should meet.</i>

1601
01:44:13,988 --> 01:44:15,580
<i>We should meet.</i>

1602
01:44:16,257 --> 01:44:18,054
<i>And we will meet.</i>

1603
01:44:18,559 --> 01:44:22,552
<i>But I'm in the middle
of a project that needs...</i>

1604
01:44:27,769 --> 01:44:29,430
<i>... tweaking.</i>

1605
01:44:49,223 --> 01:44:50,656
Some tweaking?

1606
01:44:51,292 --> 01:44:53,192
A project that needed...

1607
01:44:53,361 --> 01:44:54,487
..."tweaking."

1608
01:44:54,662 --> 01:44:58,792
- Yeah, that's what he said.
- T-W-E-A-K-I-N-G? Tweaking.

1609
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:02,469
It sounds to me like he's married.

1610
01:45:02,670 --> 01:45:03,830
Three kids.

1611
01:45:04,005 --> 01:45:06,997
That's a terrible thing to say.
He couldn't be married.

1612
01:45:07,275 --> 01:45:08,469
How do you know?

1613
01:45:08,676 --> 01:45:10,871
Have you said, "Are you married?"

1614
01:45:11,145 --> 01:45:13,739
No, I'm not going to... No.

1615
01:45:15,149 --> 01:45:18,550
<i>I know this is a little late
to be asking but...</i>

1616
01:45:19,654 --> 01:45:21,144
<i>... are you married?</i>

1617
01:45:24,659 --> 01:45:26,126
<i>Am I married?</i>

1618
01:45:26,327 --> 01:45:28,295
<i>What kind of question is that?</i>

1619
01:45:28,863 --> 01:45:31,764
<i>How can you ask me that?
Don't you know me at all?</i>

1620
01:45:32,033 --> 01:45:33,898
<i>Wait, I get it.</i>

1621
01:45:34,535 --> 01:45:37,834
<i>Your friends are saying the reason
we haven't met is I'm married.</i>

1622
01:45:38,039 --> 01:45:39,506
<i>Am I right?</i>

1623
01:45:40,842 --> 01:45:43,037
- So he didn't answer the question.
- Yes, he did.

1624
01:45:43,311 --> 01:45:46,212
- He did not.
- He did. He did. He nailed me.

1625
01:45:46,481 --> 01:45:50,383
He knew what I was after which is,
by the way, exactly like him.

1626
01:45:50,651 --> 01:45:53,882
He did not answer
the question, did he?

1627
01:45:55,156 --> 01:45:56,521
No.

1628
01:45:57,725 --> 01:45:59,920
Maybe he's fat.

1629
01:46:00,595 --> 01:46:02,529
He's fat. He's a fatty.

1630
01:46:03,297 --> 01:46:04,321
I don't care.

1631
01:46:04,499 --> 01:46:06,433
You don't care that he's so fat...

1632
01:46:06,667 --> 01:46:10,364
...he has to be removed from his house
by a crane. You don't care.

1633
01:46:10,571 --> 01:46:12,004
That is very unlikely.

1634
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:14,572
That is completely ridiculous.

1635
01:46:15,243 --> 01:46:17,040
What's his handle?

1636
01:46:20,348 --> 01:46:21,838
I'm not going to write him.

1637
01:46:22,083 --> 01:46:24,108
You think I'm going to e-mail him?

1638
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:28,012
All right, N-Y-1-5-2.

1639
01:46:28,322 --> 01:46:30,916
N-Y-1-5-2? 152.

1640
01:46:31,192 --> 01:46:33,319
He's 152 years old.

1641
01:46:34,095 --> 01:46:36,825
He's had 152 moles removed...

1642
01:46:37,064 --> 01:46:39,965
...so now he's got
152 pockmarks on his...

1643
01:46:40,635 --> 01:46:42,262
on his face.

1644
01:46:42,570 --> 01:46:46,028
The number of people who think
he looks like Clark Gable.

1645
01:46:46,340 --> 01:46:50,140
152 people who think
he looks like a Clark Bar.

1646
01:46:53,981 --> 01:46:57,576
- Why'd I even tell you?
- 152 stitches from his nose job.

1647
01:46:57,852 --> 01:47:00,878
The number of his souvenir
shot glasses...

1648
01:47:01,122 --> 01:47:04,614
...that he's collected
in his travels.

1649
01:47:05,593 --> 01:47:07,117
His address.

1650
01:47:07,395 --> 01:47:11,263
No, he would never do
anything that prosaic.

1651
01:47:15,303 --> 01:47:18,363
The only thing I
really care about is that...

1652
01:47:18,573 --> 01:47:21,736
...aside from the married thing
and the jail thing...

1653
01:47:21,943 --> 01:47:24,434
...is the boat thing.

1654
01:47:25,279 --> 01:47:26,303
What boat thing?

1655
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:28,778
I could never be
with someone who had a boat.

1656
01:47:30,484 --> 01:47:31,951
I have a boat.

1657
01:47:34,488 --> 01:47:37,082
Which clinches it.
We'll never be together.

1658
01:47:37,425 --> 01:47:38,983
- How many?
- Three.

1659
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:40,625
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

1660
01:47:40,828 --> 01:47:44,457
I could never be with
someone who likes Joni Mitchell.

1661
01:47:44,699 --> 01:47:47,759
<i>It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all</i>

1662
01:47:47,969 --> 01:47:51,405
What does that mean?
Is she a pilot?

1663
01:47:51,606 --> 01:47:54,439
It must be a metaphor,
but I don't know what it is.

1664
01:47:56,177 --> 01:47:57,542
How's your book coming?

1665
01:47:57,812 --> 01:48:00,645
There's this
children's book editor I know.

1666
01:48:00,915 --> 01:48:03,611
She's excited to read it
when I'm finished.

1667
01:48:03,818 --> 01:48:06,116
Who would ever have
thought that I would write?

1668
01:48:06,354 --> 01:48:08,686
If I hadn't had all this time...

1669
01:48:09,624 --> 01:48:11,023
- You know what?
- What?

1670
01:48:11,559 --> 01:48:15,689
The truth is he was the one who
started me thinking about writing.

1671
01:48:16,831 --> 01:48:20,164
Mr. 152 Felony Indictments.

1672
01:48:21,202 --> 01:48:24,729
Mr. 152 Insights Into My Soul.

1673
01:48:24,939 --> 01:48:27,169
Yeah.

1674
01:48:27,341 --> 01:48:29,468
No competing with that.

1675
01:48:32,046 --> 01:48:34,241
I keep on bumping into you.

1676
01:48:36,017 --> 01:48:37,314
Hope your mango's ripe.

1677
01:48:38,319 --> 01:48:39,809
I think it is.

1678
01:48:40,388 --> 01:48:42,515
You want to bump into me...

1679
01:48:42,890 --> 01:48:45,154
...on Saturday around lunchtime?

1680
01:48:45,326 --> 01:48:46,884
- Yeah.
- Over there?

1681
01:48:47,061 --> 01:48:49,029
Good.

1682
01:48:53,601 --> 01:48:56,001
<i>How about meeting...</i>

1683
01:48:56,237 --> 01:48:58,171
<i>... Saturday?</i>

1684
01:48:59,073 --> 01:49:00,870
<i>Four o'clock.</i>

1685
01:49:01,242 --> 01:49:03,506
<i>There's a place in Riverside Park
at 91 st Street...</i>

1686
01:49:03,678 --> 01:49:06,408
<i>... where the path curves
and there's a garden.</i>

1687
01:49:06,681 --> 01:49:09,047
<i>Brinkley and I will be waiting.</i>

1688
01:49:09,717 --> 01:49:11,014
Okay, let's do it.

1689
01:49:11,252 --> 01:49:12,879
Ready? And...

1690
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:14,451
Doot.

1691
01:49:14,622 --> 01:49:15,987
There it goes.

1692
01:49:16,991 --> 01:49:18,856
- Today?
- Today.

1693
01:49:20,227 --> 01:49:22,593
I know. In Riverside Park.

1694
01:49:23,998 --> 01:49:25,989
That would mean he's a Westsider.

1695
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:28,930
Maybe I've seen him
and don't even know it.

1696
01:49:29,136 --> 01:49:31,400
You could have seen him
every day and not know it.

1697
01:49:31,605 --> 01:49:32,936
It's very possible.

1698
01:49:33,107 --> 01:49:35,075
- He could be anyone.
- He could be that guy.

1699
01:49:35,242 --> 01:49:37,233
And those flowers are for you.

1700
01:49:38,879 --> 01:49:41,313
- Could be the Zipper Man.
- Who's that?

1701
01:49:41,582 --> 01:49:42,776
The Zipper Man.

1702
01:49:43,050 --> 01:49:44,074
Who is that?

1703
01:49:44,251 --> 01:49:46,742
He repairs zippers
on Amsterdam Avenue.

1704
01:49:46,954 --> 01:49:50,390
- Will you cut it out?
- You'd never have to buy new luggage.

1705
01:49:52,159 --> 01:49:56,061
The timing here is everything.
He's waited until you're primed.

1706
01:49:56,230 --> 01:49:57,254
See?

1707
01:49:57,431 --> 01:50:02,061
Until you are absolutely convinced
that there's no other man...

1708
01:50:02,303 --> 01:50:04,430
...that you could possibly love.

1709
01:50:04,638 --> 01:50:06,037
Yes.

1710
01:50:06,841 --> 01:50:08,741
You know, sometimes I wonder.

1711
01:50:09,243 --> 01:50:10,301
What?

1712
01:50:13,748 --> 01:50:15,443
If I hadn't been Fox Books...

1713
01:50:15,649 --> 01:50:18,846
...and you hadn't been
The Shop Around the Corner...

1714
01:50:19,653 --> 01:50:21,985
...and you and I had just met.

1715
01:50:22,556 --> 01:50:25,650
- I know.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1716
01:50:26,293 --> 01:50:28,318
I'd have asked for your number.

1717
01:50:30,097 --> 01:50:34,659
I wouldn't have been able to wait
24 hours before calling you and saying:

1718
01:50:36,837 --> 01:50:39,135
"How about some coffee...

1719
01:50:39,340 --> 01:50:41,501
...or drinks or dinner...

1720
01:50:41,776 --> 01:50:43,209
...or a movie...

1721
01:50:44,345 --> 01:50:46,870
...for as long as
we both shall live?"

1722
01:50:51,218 --> 01:50:52,276
Joe...

1723
01:50:52,453 --> 01:50:55,013
You and I would never
have been at war.

1724
01:50:55,890 --> 01:51:00,452
The only thing we'd fight about would be
which video to rent on a Saturday night.

1725
01:51:03,664 --> 01:51:05,097
Who fights about that?

1726
01:51:06,233 --> 01:51:07,791
Some people.

1727
01:51:09,136 --> 01:51:10,160
Not us.

1728
01:51:10,538 --> 01:51:12,335
We would never.

1729
01:51:16,977 --> 01:51:18,137
If only.

1730
01:51:23,551 --> 01:51:26,543
- I gotta go.
- Let me ask you something.

1731
01:51:31,325 --> 01:51:35,056
How can you forgive this guy
for standing you up...

1732
01:51:35,262 --> 01:51:38,527
...and not forgive me
for this tiny little thing...

1733
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:42,164
...of putting you out of business?

1734
01:51:47,541 --> 01:51:48,872
How I wish you would.

1735
01:51:51,712 --> 01:51:53,077
I really have to go.

1736
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:55,143
You don't want to be late.

1737
01:53:15,863 --> 01:53:17,524
Brinkley!

1738
01:53:21,235 --> 01:53:22,793
Brinkley!

1739
01:54:09,984 --> 01:54:12,214
Don't cry, Shopgirl.

1740
01:54:13,854 --> 01:54:14,912
Don't cry.

1741
01:54:18,659 --> 01:54:20,217
I wanted it to be you.

1742
01:54:22,396 --> 01:54:24,796
I wanted it to be you so badly.
