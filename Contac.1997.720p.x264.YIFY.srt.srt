<i>Clearly, I've never been there, but...</i>

3
00:00:52,414 --> 00:00:56,332
<i>...usually the situation,
obviously a major malfunction.</i>

4
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:12,132
<i>Whether or not their president is a crook.</i>

5
00:01:12,293 --> 00:01:13,532
<i>Well, I'm not a crook.</i>

6
00:01:13,692 --> 00:01:17,370
<i>Small step for man, one giant leap for...</i>

7
00:01:17,531 --> 00:01:21,529
<i>Robert Kennedy was shot
in that ballroom.</i>

8
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:25,529
<i>Thank God almighty, we are free at last.</i>

9
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,210
<i>A sniper has fired at President Kennedy.</i>

10
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,569
<i>The Communist party...</i>

11
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,889
<i>...or have you ever been
a member of the Communist party?</i>

12
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:43,129
<i>Old soldiers never die. They just...</i>

13
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,769
<i>Hi-yo, Silver!</i>

14
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:50,088
<i>Something never before experienced...</i>

15
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:54,488
<i>1941, a date which will live...</i>

16
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,847
<i>And we continue this final edition
of our Maxwell House Good News of 1939.</i>

17
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:05,047
<i>Good evening,
Mr. And Mrs. North America...</i>

18
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,486
<i>...and all the ships at sea.
Let's go to press.</i>

19
00:03:21,842 --> 00:03:25,841
CQ, this is W-9 GFO.

20
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:31,560
CQ, this is W-9 GFO here. Come back?

21
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:34,440
CQ.

22
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:38,919
CQ, this is W-9 GFO here.

23
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,680
Come back?

24
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,839
CQ, CQ, this is W-9 GFO.
Is anybody out there?

25
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,239
Not getting anything.

26
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,919
Small moves, Ellie.

27
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,639
Small moves.

28
00:03:57,038 --> 00:04:01,357
CQ, this is W-9 GFO here. Come back?

29
00:04:01,518 --> 00:04:05,357
Copy, W-9 GFO. K-4 WLD here.

30
00:04:05,517 --> 00:04:08,637
- What do I say?
- Just be yourself.

31
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:13,116
- Where are you, K-4 WLD? Come back?
- Pensacola. Over.

32
00:04:13,277 --> 00:04:14,796
Pensacola, where's Pensacola?

33
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:16,876
I'll give you a hint.

34
00:04:17,036 --> 00:04:18,275
Orange juice.

35
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:24,556
Copy that, K-4 WLD.
How's the weather down there in Florida?

36
00:04:25,797 --> 00:04:27,955
Pensacola, Florida.

37
00:04:28,116 --> 00:04:30,675
I have to tell you, Sparks...

38
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:34,194
...one thousand, one hundred
and sixteen miles.

39
00:04:34,356 --> 00:04:37,675
Pretty good. That's the farthest yet.

40
00:04:49,554 --> 00:04:52,713
- Can we hear all the way to New York?
- Sure.

41
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:57,833
- Can we hear all the way to California?
- I don't see why not.

42
00:04:58,554 --> 00:05:02,113
- Can we hear all the way to Alaska?
- Yeah, on a really clear day.

43
00:05:02,314 --> 00:05:04,713
Can we hear all the way to China?

44
00:05:05,234 --> 00:05:07,193
On a really, really clear day.

45
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:11,912
Could we talk to the moon?

46
00:05:12,073 --> 00:05:14,792
Well, if it's a big enough radio,
I don't see why not.

47
00:05:15,432 --> 00:05:17,351
Could we talk to Jupiter?

48
00:05:17,552 --> 00:05:20,231
Or what's the one after that?

49
00:05:20,391 --> 00:05:22,151
Don't tell me.

50
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:25,510
I'll give you a hint.

51
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:26,790
Hula-Hoops.

52
00:05:26,991 --> 00:05:30,150
- Saturn. Could we talk to Saturn?
- Mm-hm.

53
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,429
Dad, could we talk to Mom?

54
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,269
I don't think even the biggest radio
could reach that far.

55
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:52,388
All right, no more stalling.

56
00:05:53,869 --> 00:05:55,268
Okay.

57
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,108
Pensacola.

58
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:06,868
Oh, Ellie, that's a beauty.

59
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:09,987
Now get some sleep.

60
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,626
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

61
00:06:19,787 --> 00:06:22,467
Do you think there's people
on other planets?

62
00:06:22,628 --> 00:06:24,226
I don't know, Sparks.

63
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:27,586
But I guess I'd say...

64
00:06:27,747 --> 00:06:29,826
...if it is just us...

65
00:06:30,947 --> 00:06:33,186
...it seems like an awful waste of space.

66
00:06:49,505 --> 00:06:51,743
CQ, CQ.

67
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:54,144
CQ, this is W-9 GFO.

68
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:57,343
Repeat. This is W-9 GFO. Come back?

69
00:06:58,824 --> 00:07:02,063
CQ, this is W-9 GFO. Come back?

70
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:06,942
I'm gonna need a bigger antenna.

71
00:07:32,422 --> 00:07:34,100
What do you think, Doctor Arroway?

72
00:07:34,261 --> 00:07:36,180
Isn't she a beauty?

73
00:07:39,581 --> 00:07:40,661
It'll do.

74
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,740
The village is five miles away.

75
00:07:42,941 --> 00:07:47,340
There's a general store in the cantina.
They can order anything from San Juan.

76
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,020
And when can I get some dish time?

77
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,420
Dr. Clark said you wouldn't
be able to wait. Your first shift is tonight.

78
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:53,659
All right.

79
00:08:46,536 --> 00:08:47,975
Go back.

80
00:08:49,336 --> 00:08:52,294
Try back a little bit.
You had something there.

81
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,654
There.

82
00:08:54,815 --> 00:08:57,774
- Right there?
- You hear it? Right there, that's it.

83
00:08:57,935 --> 00:09:01,654
All right, 1221.46.
That's well within the L band.

84
00:09:01,815 --> 00:09:04,773
- Check off-axis.
- Uh-huh. On it.

85
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:08,373
It's not in the neighborhood.

86
00:09:13,774 --> 00:09:15,373
Ah.

87
00:09:16,493 --> 00:09:20,212
Here it is. J-1741 plus 2748.

88
00:09:20,372 --> 00:09:23,891
Catalogued November 4, 1982. Pulsar.

89
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:29,010
Well, I don't know, it must've been...
The glitch in the timing is what threw me.

90
00:09:29,172 --> 00:09:30,810
Must've been a starquake.

91
00:09:32,132 --> 00:09:35,811
I think it's great that you listen.
Most people don't do that anymore.

92
00:09:35,972 --> 00:09:38,731
It's just an old habit.
You know, it makes it feel more real.

93
00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:41,650
- Ellie.
- Kent. Kent Clark.

94
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:43,730
Hey.

95
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:48,010
They said you've been up at Owens Valley
working under Drumlin.

96
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,690
How did you like him?

97
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,689
That much? And about what I'd expect
after what he had to say about you.

98
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,768
What was that?

99
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,928
That you are brilliant, driven...

100
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:04,968
...a major pain in the ass,
and obsessed with a field of study...

101
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:08,168
...that he considers tantamount
to professional suicide.

102
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:12,048
- Anything else?
- Those were the highlights.

103
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,407
Davio, Dr. Vernon. Dr. Arroway.

104
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:15,968
- Hey. Hi there.
- How you doing?

105
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:20,528
And I believe you've already met our
tireless research assistant, Mr. Fisher...

106
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:23,367
- Here, I need you to sign...
- ...as well as his cologne.

107
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:26,007
Brook's looking at the black hole
at the center of M-87.

108
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:29,766
Eli's studying Markarian 541,
a major gamma-ray source.

109
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:34,766
And Dr. Arroway will be spending her
precious telescope time listening for, um...

110
00:10:35,127 --> 00:10:37,045
Listening for, um...

111
00:10:37,206 --> 00:10:38,638
Little green men.

112
00:10:46,365 --> 00:10:49,804
One down, a couple billion to go.

113
00:11:05,805 --> 00:11:07,683
Arecibo, right?

114
00:11:08,804 --> 00:11:09,923
Does it show?

115
00:11:10,524 --> 00:11:11,723
Yeah.

116
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:14,083
- Cracker Jack?
- No, thanks.

117
00:11:14,244 --> 00:11:15,722
- Mind if I sit down?
- Sure.

118
00:11:17,324 --> 00:11:21,163
I hear the locals, they call it El Radar.

119
00:11:21,323 --> 00:11:24,042
Convinced it has
some dark military purpose.

120
00:11:24,203 --> 00:11:25,562
I think we're pretty harmless.

121
00:11:26,963 --> 00:11:28,041
Palmer Joss.

122
00:11:28,843 --> 00:11:31,201
- Ellie Arroway.
- Nice to meet you, Ellie.

123
00:11:32,363 --> 00:11:35,201
What are you studying up there?

124
00:11:36,803 --> 00:11:38,121
The usual.

125
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:41,200
You know. Nebulae, quasars, pulsars,
stuff like that.

126
00:11:41,362 --> 00:11:43,841
What are you...?
What are you writing?

127
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:48,200
The usual. Nouns, adverbs,
adjective here and there.

128
00:11:49,481 --> 00:11:50,921
I work on a project called SETI.

129
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:53,640
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence?

130
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:57,719
Wow. Man, that is out there.

131
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:00,239
Wait, are you a student or something?

132
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,558
Mm-mm. I'm a writer.
I'm writing a book.

133
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:08,199
Down here doing research about how
technology affects Third World cultures.

134
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:11,078
I'm also looking for this guy
David Drumlin.

135
00:12:11,238 --> 00:12:15,517
He's the new head of the National Science
Foundation. I'm trying to get an interview.

136
00:12:16,358 --> 00:12:19,237
- I take it you know him?
- Mm-hm.

137
00:12:19,398 --> 00:12:21,277
You could say that.

138
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:25,597
SETI, man.
That's fringe.

139
00:12:25,758 --> 00:12:27,237
I've crossed paths with this guy.

140
00:12:27,398 --> 00:12:29,957
Something like that
must really chap his ass, huh?

141
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:34,117
Compass.

142
00:12:35,717 --> 00:12:37,236
For you, EI.

143
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:43,356
You better keep this.

144
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,235
Might save your life someday.

145
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,956
Will you have dinner with me tonight?

146
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:54,619
I...

147
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:58,355
I don't make a very good research subject.
I'm just not very quotable.

148
00:12:58,516 --> 00:13:02,114
No quotes. No quotes. Scout's honor.
Just a good meal, good company.

149
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,675
I gotta go.

150
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:09,794
But, uh...
But...

151
00:13:12,954 --> 00:13:14,906
Drumlirs coming in this Tuesday.

152
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:26,952
Now I remember why I took that desk job.

153
00:13:27,912 --> 00:13:30,352
- Dr. Drumlin, how are you?
- Dr. Drumlin.

154
00:13:31,273 --> 00:13:33,271
Glad you could make it, David.

155
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:36,831
If I'd known it was gonna take
three planes, I might've reconsidered.

156
00:13:36,992 --> 00:13:38,311
How is that new office?

157
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:42,871
I'm still settling in. They already wanna take
half my budget and give it to the Pentagon.

158
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:45,791
Ellie. Still waiting for E.T. To call?

159
00:13:45,952 --> 00:13:49,791
- Well, I understand we're having a little...
- Good to see you too.

160
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:50,911
Asshole.

161
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:53,310
Uh-oh. Looks like
it's gonna be a long night.

162
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:57,750
Science must first be accountable to the
people who are paying for it, the taxpayers.

163
00:13:57,911 --> 00:14:01,150
We need to stop wasting money
on pie-in-the-sky abstractions...

164
00:14:01,311 --> 00:14:04,149
...and start spending it on practical,
measurable ways...

165
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,069
...to improve the lives of the people
who are footing the bill.

166
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,229
Not unlike my L-band,
globular-clusters work.

167
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,308
Wait, you're saying you wanna do away
with all pure research now?

168
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,669
What's wrong with science being practical?
Even profitable?

169
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:20,548
Nothing, as long as your motive
is the search for truth.

170
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:23,708
Which is exactly what
the pursuit of science is.

171
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:26,948
That's a rather interesting position...

172
00:14:27,109 --> 00:14:30,628
...coming from a man on a crusade
against the evils of technology...

173
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:31,827
...Father Joss.

174
00:14:32,469 --> 00:14:34,747
I'm not against technology, doctor.

175
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:38,986
I'm against the men who deify it
at the expense of human truth.

176
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:45,746
Kent, I've been meaning to have
a word with you. Over here, please.

177
00:14:45,907 --> 00:14:47,705
Yeah, I'll just...

178
00:14:51,546 --> 00:14:54,545
I think that hurt my chances
with that interview. What do you think?

179
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:56,904
You're a priest?

180
00:14:58,346 --> 00:14:59,544
No, not really.

181
00:15:00,185 --> 00:15:03,144
I got my Masters in Divinity...

182
00:15:03,306 --> 00:15:06,744
...then dropped out of seminary to
do some secular humanitarian work...

183
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:09,304
...coordinating efforts
for Third World churches.

184
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:12,424
I couldn't live with
the whole celibacy thing.

185
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,024
You could...

186
00:15:16,185 --> 00:15:18,664
You could call me a man of the cloth...

187
00:15:19,464 --> 00:15:20,983
...without the cloth.

188
00:15:24,183 --> 00:15:25,783
You wanna get out of here?

189
00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:30,983
All right, you see that sort of large,
W-shaped constellation right there?

190
00:15:31,144 --> 00:15:32,542
That's Cassiopeia.

191
00:15:32,703 --> 00:15:37,062
And Cassiopeia A gives off
a whole lot of radio signals.

192
00:15:37,223 --> 00:15:41,542
I actually listen to them a lot.
It's a remnant of a supernova.

193
00:15:42,223 --> 00:15:44,982
When did you know
you wanted to be an astronomer?

194
00:15:45,462 --> 00:15:46,861
Well, when I...

195
00:15:47,022 --> 00:15:50,701
When I was about 8 years old,
I was watching the sunset...

196
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:54,101
...and I asked my dad,
"What's that bright star over there?"

197
00:15:54,262 --> 00:15:56,820
Dad, what's that star there?

198
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,340
And he said that it wasrt
really a star at all. It was actually...

199
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,099
That's not a star, it's a planet.

200
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,819
A whole planet called Venus...

201
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,899
That's the planet Venus.

202
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,939
Which should be over there soon.

203
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,698
He said,
"You know why they called it Venus?"

204
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,018
"Because they thought
it was so beautiful and glowing."

205
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,178
"But what they didn't know..."

206
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,858
"...is that it's filled with..."

207
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:27,578
"...deadly gases and sulfuric acid rain."

208
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:32,617
"Wow," I thought,
"This is it! I'm hooked."

209
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:37,937
You know, there are four hundred billion
stars out there...

210
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,257
...just in our galaxy alone.

211
00:16:40,577 --> 00:16:44,337
If only one out of a million
of those had planets...

212
00:16:44,498 --> 00:16:47,537
...all right, and ifjust one
out of a million of those had life...

213
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:52,136
...and ifjust one out of a million
of those had intelligent life...

214
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:57,216
...there would be literally millions
of civilizations out there.

215
00:16:58,576 --> 00:17:00,576
Well, if there wasrt...

216
00:17:00,977 --> 00:17:03,375
...it'd be an awful waste of space.

217
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,415
Amen.

218
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:23,212
So I was lying there,
just looking at the sky.

219
00:17:26,014 --> 00:17:29,692
And then I felt something.
I don't know, I...

220
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,933
All I know is that I wasrt alone.

221
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:37,812
And for the first time in my life
I wasrt scared of nothing, you know?

222
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,852
Not even dying.

223
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:46,931
It was God.

224
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:51,531
And there's no chance that...

225
00:17:51,692 --> 00:17:55,771
...you had this experience because
some part of you needed to have it?

226
00:17:56,971 --> 00:18:00,331
I mean, I'm a reasonably intelligent guy,
but this...

227
00:18:03,051 --> 00:18:06,890
No, this... No, my intellect,
it couldn't even touch this.

228
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:08,049
No.

229
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,889
I've been to Sunday school a few times.

230
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,929
Uh-huh. And?

231
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:21,129
Well, I just kept asking all these
really annoying questions like:

232
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,129
"All right, then where did Mrs. Cain
come from?"

233
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:27,848
And pretty soon they called my dad
and they asked him...

234
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,649
...if he wouldn't mind just
keeping me home from now on.

235
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,768
Your dad...

236
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,768
- Is it this guy?
- Yeah.

237
00:18:38,568 --> 00:18:40,927
You're close to him, aren't you?

238
00:18:41,768 --> 00:18:45,086
Yeah, I was.
He died when I was 9 years old.

239
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:48,806
I never got to know my mother.

240
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:51,606
I'm sorry.

241
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,766
That's gotta be tough.

242
00:18:59,886 --> 00:19:01,485
Yeah.

243
00:19:02,086 --> 00:19:04,005
Being alone.

244
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,364
What do you say...

245
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:16,924
...we pack a picnic tomorrow morning
and hike up to old Mount Arecibo?

246
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:20,644
I don't think I can.
I gotta work.

247
00:19:22,365 --> 00:19:25,843
All right, how about dinner, then,
tomorrow night? I know a great dive.

248
00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:27,883
I don't think so.

249
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,043
- Ellie, did I miss something?
- Huh?

250
00:19:36,124 --> 00:19:39,203
No. Shit, I'm late.

251
00:19:40,124 --> 00:19:43,562
I told Kent that I'd be there at 10:30.

252
00:19:45,443 --> 00:19:47,162
You know, I'm not trying to push you.

253
00:19:47,363 --> 00:19:49,682
No, no. I've wanted to look at
this sector for weeks.

254
00:19:49,843 --> 00:19:54,881
Just hang out and sleep in.
And there's a bunch of food in the fridge.

255
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:56,161
Okay?

256
00:19:56,323 --> 00:19:58,081
How can I reach you?

257
00:19:58,721 --> 00:20:01,120
Just leave your number.
I'll call you.

258
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,718
Dad!

259
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:27,558
Dad, it's starting,
you're gonna miss it.

260
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,758
Dad, there's another one.
Hurry up.

261
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:35,198
In a minute, Sparks.
I'm almost done.

262
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,077
There's another one.
Come on, hurry up, Dad!

263
00:20:43,294 --> 00:20:44,250
Dad?

264
00:20:56,238 --> 00:20:57,196
Dad?

265
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:07,956
Daddy?

266
00:21:20,395 --> 00:21:21,474
Dad.

267
00:21:25,023 --> 00:21:25,982
Dad.

268
00:21:27,901 --> 00:21:29,052
Dad.

269
00:21:31,354 --> 00:21:33,002
I'll get the medicine.

270
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:47,267
Ellie.

271
00:22:48,788 --> 00:22:51,347
I know it's hard to understand this now...

272
00:22:52,308 --> 00:22:56,626
...but we aren't always meant to know
why things happen the way they do.

273
00:22:57,147 --> 00:23:01,306
Sometimes we just have to accept it
as God's will.

274
00:23:03,187 --> 00:23:06,706
I should have kept some medicine
in the downstairs bathroom.

275
00:23:06,866 --> 00:23:09,306
Then I could've gotten to it sooner.

276
00:23:33,785 --> 00:23:35,383
CQ...

277
00:23:36,185 --> 00:23:39,344
...this is W-9 GFO. Do you copy?

278
00:23:42,384 --> 00:23:44,943
Dad, this is Ellie.
Come back.

279
00:23:47,984 --> 00:23:49,942
This is Eleanor Arroway...

280
00:23:50,104 --> 00:23:53,542
...transmitting on 14.2 megahertz.

281
00:23:55,944 --> 00:23:57,462
Dad.

282
00:23:59,422 --> 00:24:00,861
Are you there?

283
00:24:02,902 --> 00:24:04,301
Come back.

284
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:08,460
Dad.

285
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,140
Are you there?

286
00:24:13,141 --> 00:24:14,581
Dad, this is Ellie.

287
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:46,018
Ellie.

288
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:49,418
Hi, Kent. What are you doing
up so early, huh?

289
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:51,338
I was thinking...

290
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:53,498
...we'd make a pretty good team.

291
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:54,657
What?

292
00:24:54,818 --> 00:24:58,177
We could put together
a kick-ass ad-hoc SETI program.

293
00:24:58,378 --> 00:25:00,497
You know the Very Large Array
in New Mexico?

294
00:25:00,658 --> 00:25:03,016
It would be a dynamite place
to do serious SETI...

295
00:25:03,178 --> 00:25:05,737
What are you talking about, Kent?

296
00:25:07,137 --> 00:25:08,936
Drumlin pulled the plug.

297
00:25:09,537 --> 00:25:10,616
We're homeless.

298
00:25:20,776 --> 00:25:22,494
Hey, watch it.

299
00:25:24,175 --> 00:25:26,015
Is it true, huh? Did you pull the plug?

300
00:25:26,176 --> 00:25:28,454
You can't see it now,
but I'm doing you a favor.

301
00:25:28,615 --> 00:25:32,614
You are far too promising a scientist
to be wasting your gifts on this nonsense.

302
00:25:32,774 --> 00:25:34,693
Look, I don't consider what could be...

303
00:25:34,895 --> 00:25:37,774
...the most important discovery
of the human race nonsense, okay?

304
00:25:37,935 --> 00:25:39,294
There's 400 billion stars...

305
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:42,214
And two probabilities.
One, there is intelligent life...

306
00:25:42,414 --> 00:25:45,293
...but it's so far away you'll
never contact it in your lifetime.

307
00:25:45,454 --> 00:25:47,573
- And two!
- You're making a decision...

308
00:25:47,733 --> 00:25:51,972
There's nothing but noble gases and carbon
compounds and you're wasting your time.

309
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:55,093
In the meantime, you won't be published,
won't be taken seriously.

310
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:56,893
And your career will be over.

311
00:25:57,053 --> 00:26:00,292
So what? It's my life.

312
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:38,570
Hey, Kent.
You were right.

313
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:42,289
Screw Drumlin. We're gonna raise
the money. We're going to New Mexico.

314
00:26:42,449 --> 00:26:44,888
Chicago has all the stuff,
but let me know how it goes.

315
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:47,808
I've got some more corporate stops
on the East Coast for you.

316
00:26:47,969 --> 00:26:51,008
Hey, Fish, did that investor from Houston
ever get back to us?

317
00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:53,088
I'm gonna hit him up on my way to L.A.

318
00:26:53,288 --> 00:26:55,327
Try begging for some of that
Hollywood money.

319
00:26:55,528 --> 00:26:58,967
Why not? They've been making money
off of aliens for years, right?

320
00:26:59,128 --> 00:27:01,847
- Begging is good for the soul.
- We'll see about that.

321
00:27:02,008 --> 00:27:03,607
- Just do me a favor.
- Yeah.

322
00:27:03,768 --> 00:27:06,446
Try not to be too confrontational.

323
00:27:06,607 --> 00:27:08,966
Huh? Confrontational? Me?
What do you mean?

324
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,686
I'm gonna see if I left anything.

325
00:27:42,685 --> 00:27:46,364
This is a unique time in our history,
in the history of any civilization.

326
00:27:46,525 --> 00:27:49,204
It's the moment
of the acquisition of technology.

327
00:27:49,405 --> 00:27:52,123
That's the moment
where contact becomes possible.

328
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:57,443
The Very Large Array in New Mexico
is the key to our chances for success.

329
00:27:57,604 --> 00:27:59,762
With its 27 linked radio telescopes...

330
00:27:59,923 --> 00:28:03,162
...we can search more accurately
than at any other conventional facility.

331
00:28:03,323 --> 00:28:08,281
Now, we've gotten approval to buy
the telescope time from the government.

332
00:28:08,762 --> 00:28:10,841
Now all we really need is the money.

333
00:28:11,602 --> 00:28:13,521
A nice presentation, doctor.

334
00:28:14,202 --> 00:28:18,521
But while our foundation arm has a mandate
to support experimental programs...

335
00:28:18,682 --> 00:28:22,481
...we must confess that
your proposal seems less like science...

336
00:28:22,642 --> 00:28:24,281
...and more like science fiction.

337
00:28:26,681 --> 00:28:28,080
Science fiction.

338
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:33,080
You're right.

339
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,039
It's crazy.

340
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:38,639
Nuts.

341
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,559
You wanna hear something nutty?

342
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,279
A couple guys wanted to build
something called an airplane.

343
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,479
You get people to go in it
and fly like birds. Ridiculous, right?

344
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:49,519
Or what about
breaking the sound barrier...

345
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,158
...or rockets to the moon,
or atomic energy or a mission to Mars?

346
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,118
Science fiction, right?

347
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,358
Look.

348
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:00,598
All I'm asking is for you to
just have the tiniest bit of vision.

349
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:04,198
You know, to just step back for one minute
and look at the big picture.

350
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:05,757
To take a chance on something...

351
00:29:05,918 --> 00:29:09,397
...which might end up being
the most profoundly impactful moment...

352
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:13,557
...for humanity, for the history of history.

353
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:18,116
I'm sorry.

354
00:29:19,197 --> 00:29:20,756
I just spent the last 13 months...

355
00:29:21,396 --> 00:29:24,595
...coming into rooms like this
and talking to people like you.

356
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:27,595
The truth is, you're my last chance, so...

357
00:29:27,756 --> 00:29:29,155
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

358
00:29:29,316 --> 00:29:30,554
Doctor.

359
00:29:30,716 --> 00:29:31,740
Yes, sir.

360
00:29:35,001 --> 00:29:35,960
Yes, sir.

361
00:29:39,797 --> 00:29:40,946
Yes, sir.

362
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:44,874
You have your money.

363
00:29:47,795 --> 00:29:52,393
Thank you.

364
00:30:37,032 --> 00:30:40,909
Oh! Perfect cast.
Come on, fishy.

365
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,589
Frank, look at the size
of that son of a bitch!

366
00:30:56,509 --> 00:30:58,508
Welcome back, Dr. C.

367
00:30:58,669 --> 00:31:00,107
How'd it go?

368
00:31:00,749 --> 00:31:03,868
- How was the trip?
- I've had better.

369
00:31:04,349 --> 00:31:07,307
Drumlin. What is this?
This his personal vendetta now?

370
00:31:07,468 --> 00:31:11,227
It's not just Drumlin. There's been enormous
pressure from other scientists as well.

371
00:31:11,388 --> 00:31:14,506
It doesn't matter anyway,
Hadders funding us for another two years.

372
00:31:14,668 --> 00:31:17,707
Uh... These are government-owned
telescopes, they can lease to whomever.

373
00:31:17,868 --> 00:31:21,506
And they don't want the high priestess
of the desert using them anymore.

374
00:31:22,308 --> 00:31:23,306
What?

375
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:26,666
Staring at static on TV for hours,
listening to washing machines.

376
00:31:26,827 --> 00:31:29,106
Did you really think these stories
wouldn't get out?

377
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:32,866
- I was looking for patterns in the chaos.
- Doesrt matter, we're a joke to them.

378
00:31:33,026 --> 00:31:34,506
They want us out.

379
00:31:35,906 --> 00:31:39,105
We've got three months
until the paperwork goes through.

380
00:31:41,706 --> 00:31:44,745
Fine. I'll start looking for other funding.
I'll just start...

381
00:31:44,906 --> 00:31:49,224
Could you face reality, please?
Just this once, Ellie. We lost.

382
00:31:49,385 --> 00:31:50,984
It's over.

383
00:31:57,065 --> 00:31:58,663
Fine.

384
00:31:58,825 --> 00:32:00,742
But I'm not stopping.

385
00:32:00,904 --> 00:32:03,782
If I have to go it alone, I'll go it alone.
I've done it before.

386
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,099
<i>My guest tonight is author
and theologian Palmer Joss.</i>

387
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:00,059
<i>He's become a spiritual counselor of sorts
and a recent fixture at the White House.</i>

388
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,059
<i>"God's Diplomat,"
according to The New York Times.</i>

389
00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:06,779
<i>His latest book, Losing Faith,
is currently number one...</i>

390
00:33:06,979 --> 00:33:09,218
<i>...on that publicatiors bestseller list.</i>

391
00:33:09,379 --> 00:33:10,818
<i>Thanks for being with us, Palmer.</i>

392
00:33:10,979 --> 00:33:13,658
<i>You have had quite a ride
this last couple of years.</i>

393
00:33:13,818 --> 00:33:16,177
<i>Yeah, I sure have, Larry.</i>

394
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:18,738
You know, Fish, I was thinking.

395
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:23,056
<i>Who would make the best astronomers?
I mean, think about it.</i>

396
00:33:23,217 --> 00:33:28,976
Who has the perfect synthesis
of career and lifestyle?

397
00:33:29,137 --> 00:33:31,935
- I give.
- Vampires!

398
00:33:32,096 --> 00:33:34,415
<i>Are you anti-technology?
Are you anti-science?</i>

399
00:33:34,576 --> 00:33:36,495
<i>No, not at all.</i>

400
00:33:36,656 --> 00:33:39,415
<i>The question that I'm asking is this:</i>

401
00:33:40,056 --> 00:33:42,655
<i>Are we happier as a human race?</i>

402
00:33:42,816 --> 00:33:47,535
<i>Is the world fundamentally a better place
because of science and technology?</i>

403
00:33:48,216 --> 00:33:50,574
<i>We shop at home, we surf the Web...</i>

404
00:33:50,775 --> 00:33:53,454
<i>...but at the same time we feel emptier...</i>

405
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:58,253
<i>...and more cut off from each other
than at any other time in human history.</i>

406
00:33:58,415 --> 00:34:00,974
<i>I mean, we're becoming
a synthesized society...</i>

407
00:34:01,134 --> 00:34:03,662
<i>...in a great, big hurry
to get to the next...</i>

408
00:34:17,173 --> 00:34:20,532
<i>I think it's because we're looking
for the meaning. What is the meaning?</i>

409
00:34:20,693 --> 00:34:23,292
<i>We have mindless jobs,
we take frantic vacations.</i>

410
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:26,572
<i>Deficit finance trips to the mall
to buy more things...</i>

411
00:34:26,772 --> 00:34:30,292
<i>...that we think are gonna fill
these holes in our lives.</i>

412
00:34:30,453 --> 00:34:32,892
<i>Is it any wonder that we've lost
our sense of direction?</i>

413
00:35:12,089 --> 00:35:13,687
Holy shit.

414
00:35:31,247 --> 00:35:37,046
Right ascension,
18 hours, 36 minutes, 56.2 seconds.

415
00:35:37,207 --> 00:35:42,006
Declination, plus 36 degrees,
46 minutes...

416
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:45,205
...56.2 seconds!

417
00:35:46,807 --> 00:35:48,245
Confirm!

418
00:35:48,406 --> 00:35:54,085
Right ascension, 18 hours, 36 minutes,
56.2 seconds!

419
00:35:54,246 --> 00:35:56,965
Hey, is anybody awake in there?
I'm moving the array!

420
00:35:58,006 --> 00:36:00,685
- Confirm!
- Boss has a bogey!

421
00:36:00,885 --> 00:36:05,803
Right ascension, 18 hours,
36 minutes, 56.2 seconds.

422
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:08,123
- Fish!
- We're on it.

423
00:36:08,284 --> 00:36:12,443
Plus 36 hours,
47 minutes and 1 second.

424
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:16,202
Strong possible pulse chain
on Sub-Array 4.

425
00:36:16,404 --> 00:36:19,603
I'm moving the rest of them now.
I need you to confirm the coordinates.

426
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:21,682
Check the status of the array.

427
00:36:21,843 --> 00:36:25,562
- She's doing all the dishes.
- All systems nominal.

428
00:36:30,003 --> 00:36:31,522
Hello.

429
00:36:32,242 --> 00:36:33,921
I need a full systems check.

430
00:36:34,082 --> 00:36:36,801
Coordinates confirmed.
Willie's checking the system now.

431
00:36:36,962 --> 00:36:39,841
Stay on top of the systems diagnostics.

432
00:36:40,002 --> 00:36:41,641
Check the reference point offsets.

433
00:36:41,841 --> 00:36:45,680
And I want you off-axis on 27
the second we get there.

434
00:36:45,841 --> 00:36:48,241
And tell Willie to break out the big boy.

435
00:36:49,761 --> 00:36:52,000
Copy that. Willie...

436
00:36:52,161 --> 00:36:53,360
Yeah. Go, Ellie.

437
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:56,680
I can hear can it on the headphones.
We gotta be sure about this.

438
00:36:56,841 --> 00:36:59,439
Give me another array status.

439
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,600
Her four are online,
the rest are tracking in.

440
00:37:03,761 --> 00:37:06,399
Your four are online,
the rest are tracking in.

441
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,839
But there's a bad drive on 16.

442
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,439
Your four are online,
the rest are tracking in...

443
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,319
...but there's a bad drive on 16.
Copy that?

444
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,719
What do you want me to do
about the source queue?

445
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,878
Look, forget about it and hold the queue.

446
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:24,037
Go get ready to set the target frequency
to manual the second we're aligned.

447
00:37:24,238 --> 00:37:28,397
Do you copy? I want you to go
off-axis on 27 the second we're there.

448
00:37:28,637 --> 00:37:31,356
And leave the LO frequency where it is.

449
00:37:31,517 --> 00:37:34,676
Stay on it, Fish, don't let it get away.
If you lose it, scan the band.

450
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:37,996
Run every frequency you can think of.

451
00:37:42,397 --> 00:37:44,036
How you doing?

452
00:37:48,076 --> 00:37:49,156
Talk to me, guys.

453
00:37:49,356 --> 00:37:53,035
Partially polarized set of moving pulses,
amplitude modulated.

454
00:37:53,196 --> 00:37:56,714
We're locked. Systems check out, signal
across the board. What's the frequency?

455
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:59,795
4.46, 23 gigahertz.

456
00:38:01,115 --> 00:38:04,235
Hydrogen times pi. Told you.

457
00:38:04,395 --> 00:38:06,114
Strong sucker too.

458
00:38:06,275 --> 00:38:08,514
I got it! I got it, I got it!
I'm patched in.

459
00:38:09,194 --> 00:38:10,794
All right, let me hear it.

460
00:38:15,634 --> 00:38:17,033
Listen to that.

461
00:38:19,195 --> 00:38:21,353
Make me a liar, Fish.

462
00:38:21,514 --> 00:38:24,073
It could be AWACS out of Kirtland
jamming us.

463
00:38:24,234 --> 00:38:25,553
But I'm doubting it.

464
00:38:25,714 --> 00:38:28,233
All right, let's see
if F.U.D.D.'s reading it too.

465
00:38:29,034 --> 00:38:32,232
Willie, patch it back
and give me the off-axis.

466
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,993
- Are we recording?
- Never stopped.

467
00:38:35,993 --> 00:38:37,232
Thank you, Elmer.

468
00:38:37,433 --> 00:38:39,272
AWACS status is negative.

469
00:38:39,433 --> 00:38:42,151
- White Sands?
- On this frequency? No.

470
00:38:42,312 --> 00:38:43,750
I'm gonna punch up the darks.

471
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:50,310
How's the spying tonight, guys?
Come on.

472
00:38:52,551 --> 00:38:54,950
NORAD's not tracking
any snoops in this vector.

473
00:38:55,111 --> 00:38:56,630
Shuttle Endeavor is in sleep mode.

474
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:59,190
Okay, point source confirmed.

475
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:01,830
- Whatever it is, it ain't local.
- Position?

476
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,549
I checked interferometry.
Somewhere in Lyra, I think.

477
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,149
- Vega?
- Can't be.

478
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,469
It's only 26 light years away.

479
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:11,468
- What's the peak intensity?
- Coming up.

480
00:39:11,629 --> 00:39:12,828
Vega.

481
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:16,789
Vega. I scanned it a bunch of times at
Arecibo. It was negative results, always.

482
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:20,228
Got it. Reading over 100 janskys.

483
00:39:20,389 --> 00:39:22,668
Jesus. I could pick it up on my...

484
00:39:25,669 --> 00:39:26,628
No.

485
00:39:58,587 --> 00:39:59,585
Come on.

486
00:40:01,826 --> 00:40:03,825
All right, it's restarting.

487
00:40:04,265 --> 00:40:05,944
Wait a minute.
Those are numbers.

488
00:40:06,145 --> 00:40:09,104
That was a three,
the one before it was a two.

489
00:40:09,265 --> 00:40:12,544
Base-10 numbers. Just start counting now,
see how far can we get.

490
00:40:12,705 --> 00:40:14,263
One.

491
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,623
- Seven.
- Seven.

492
00:40:23,344 --> 00:40:24,863
Those are primes.

493
00:40:25,024 --> 00:40:27,503
Two, three, five, seven,
those are all prime numbers.

494
00:40:27,664 --> 00:40:29,542
There's no way
that's a natural phenomenon.

495
00:40:29,704 --> 00:40:30,782
- Holy shit.
- Okay, okay.

496
00:40:30,943 --> 00:40:34,142
Let's just calm down
and pull up the star file on Vega.

497
00:40:34,663 --> 00:40:37,502
It doesn't make any sense.
The system is too young...

498
00:40:37,663 --> 00:40:39,582
...so it can't have a planetary system...

499
00:40:39,743 --> 00:40:43,022
...let alone life
or a technological civilization.

500
00:40:43,183 --> 00:40:45,661
Maybe they didn't grow up there.
Maybe they're visiting.

501
00:40:45,822 --> 00:40:49,021
Spacecraft? This system is full of debris.
It would get clobbered.

502
00:40:49,182 --> 00:40:53,181
Well, not if they used their laser blasters
and photon torpedoes.

503
00:40:53,341 --> 00:40:56,621
- That's not funny.
- How else are we gonna explain it?

504
00:40:56,781 --> 00:40:59,860
Willie's right. If we go public with this
and we're wrong, that's it.

505
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:02,420
It's over.
We're cooked.

506
00:41:03,381 --> 00:41:05,860
God, I wish Kent was here.

507
00:41:06,021 --> 00:41:09,939
Whatever the signal is, we better
do something soon. Vega's gonna set.

508
00:41:10,461 --> 00:41:16,780
Position confirmed.
We've got 4.4623 gigahertz, confirmed.

509
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,739
We've got 112 janskys.

510
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,259
All right, do you have
a source location yet?

511
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:27,497
We put it right smack in the middle.

512
00:41:27,658 --> 00:41:29,177
Vega.

513
00:41:30,938 --> 00:41:33,817
Okay, thanks, lan. Keep tracking
and we'll get back to you.

514
00:41:33,978 --> 00:41:35,577
Yeah, right-o.

515
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:46,776
Okay, 101.

516
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:51,496
The pulse sequenced through every
prime number between two and 101.

517
00:41:53,016 --> 00:41:54,935
Who are we gonna call now?

518
00:41:57,656 --> 00:41:58,696
Everybody.

519
00:42:06,136 --> 00:42:09,415
The rumors are flying,
the implications extraordinary.

520
00:42:09,576 --> 00:42:13,054
This morning's detection of an unidentified
radio source from deep space...

521
00:42:13,215 --> 00:42:15,735
...can neither be confirmed nor denied.

522
00:42:15,895 --> 00:42:17,614
But the military presence arriving...

523
00:42:17,775 --> 00:42:21,494
Sources close to the VLA report
that the planet has been contacted...

524
00:42:21,654 --> 00:42:23,534
...by some form of intelligent being...

525
00:42:23,695 --> 00:42:27,053
...living outside of our solar system.
Again, there is no confirmation...

526
00:42:27,215 --> 00:42:30,973
...that the official IAU communiquй
was sent from this government facility.

527
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:33,733
I want all of these people out of here.

528
00:42:33,894 --> 00:42:35,613
Where's the girl?

529
00:42:39,613 --> 00:42:42,412
Twenty-two stations worldwide
now confirming the signal.

530
00:42:42,573 --> 00:42:44,291
Vega is currently below our horizon...

531
00:42:44,452 --> 00:42:46,811
...so what you're hearing
is the signal from...

532
00:42:46,972 --> 00:42:50,611
Get decryption people in here now.
Lunacharsky is visiting at Cal Tech.

533
00:42:50,772 --> 00:42:52,171
Explain this to me.

534
00:42:52,371 --> 00:42:56,090
If the source of the signal is so
sophisticated, why the remedial math?

535
00:42:56,251 --> 00:42:57,971
Exactly, why don't they speak English?

536
00:42:58,131 --> 00:43:01,210
Maybe because 70 percent of the planet
speaks other languages.

537
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:04,050
Mathematics is
the only truly universal language.

538
00:43:04,731 --> 00:43:07,210
It's no coincidence
that they're using primes.

539
00:43:07,411 --> 00:43:09,529
- I don't get it.
- Prime numbers.

540
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:13,330
That would be integers that are
only divisible by themselves and one.

541
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:19,569
We think this may be a beacon,
some kind of an announcement...

542
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:20,809
...to get our attention.

543
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:24,529
If it's attention you want, you got that.
Vega.

544
00:43:24,729 --> 00:43:28,088
People have been looking at Vega for years
with no results.

545
00:43:28,249 --> 00:43:30,968
And now yesterday they start
broadcasting primes. Why?

546
00:43:31,129 --> 00:43:34,848
Well, it's hardly yesterday, because the
signal has been transmitting for 26 years.

547
00:43:35,009 --> 00:43:36,408
Dr. Arroway.

548
00:43:36,569 --> 00:43:40,608
- Excuse me, who are you?
- Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.

549
00:43:40,769 --> 00:43:42,007
Let me first say that your...

550
00:43:42,168 --> 00:43:45,968
Actually, first, could you ask the gentlemen
with the firearms to wait outside?

551
00:43:46,128 --> 00:43:48,047
This is supposed to be a civilian facility.

552
00:43:54,247 --> 00:43:56,767
- Doctor, with all due respect to your...
- Excuse me.

553
00:43:57,127 --> 00:44:00,326
Hey, hey, hey.
Hi, I'm so glad you're back.

554
00:44:00,887 --> 00:44:03,965
Come on, I got something for you to hear.
Is this great?

555
00:44:04,126 --> 00:44:06,445
- Who are all these people?
- I have no idea.

556
00:44:06,646 --> 00:44:09,484
Sit down. And we could use some help
with the spectrum analysis.

557
00:44:09,646 --> 00:44:11,524
- Listen to that. I'll get on it.
- Headsets.

558
00:44:11,685 --> 00:44:13,684
So I'll just come right to the point,
shall I?

559
00:44:13,965 --> 00:44:17,804
Your having sent this all over the world may
constitute a breach of national security.

560
00:44:17,965 --> 00:44:19,564
This isn't a person-to-person call.

561
00:44:19,765 --> 00:44:24,084
You can't think that a civilization sending
this would intend it just for Americans.

562
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,004
I'm saying you might have consulted us.

563
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:29,803
- The contents could be extremely sensitive.
- You want to classify prime numbers?

564
00:44:29,964 --> 00:44:33,563
Mike, please. We're only in line
with Vega so many hours a day.

565
00:44:33,724 --> 00:44:38,003
The only way to monitor the signal
is to get the cooperation of other stations.

566
00:44:38,164 --> 00:44:42,362
If Dr. Arroway hadrt acted quickly,
we could have lost key elements.

567
00:44:42,523 --> 00:44:44,082
Okay, fine, they've got the primes.

568
00:44:44,244 --> 00:44:47,242
If you're right about there being a more
significant transmission...

569
00:44:47,403 --> 00:44:49,002
Which will need help
to receive and decode.

570
00:44:49,163 --> 00:44:50,922
Doctor, do you understand that my job
is to protect...?

571
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:52,801
- Shh!
- What?

572
00:44:52,963 --> 00:44:54,961
- Listen.
- I hear it.

573
00:44:55,122 --> 00:44:56,801
- Hear what?
- Harmonic.

574
00:44:56,962 --> 00:45:01,041
Bingo. I had Willie ask Rattan
to retune to 8.9247 gigahertz.

575
00:45:01,202 --> 00:45:02,641
There's a lot more here, folks.

576
00:45:02,802 --> 00:45:05,641
- Fish, let's get on the negative sideband.
- I'm already on it.

577
00:45:05,801 --> 00:45:07,320
- What is going on?
- Another signal.

578
00:45:07,481 --> 00:45:08,761
Another signal, look at that.

579
00:45:08,922 --> 00:45:11,921
A second signal at double the frequency.
It looks like a...

580
00:45:12,082 --> 00:45:13,400
Somebody get a TV monitor.

581
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:15,920
Patch the recording
into the image processor.

582
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:19,239
- You want the new data?
- Yeah, the new frequency we just recorded.

583
00:45:19,441 --> 00:45:21,280
David, explain this to me, please.

584
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,439
With the prime there's another signal.
Looks like a TV transmission.

585
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:25,718
We're hot.

586
00:45:25,879 --> 00:45:28,838
Do me a favor, go get the blinds.
There is a lot of glare.

587
00:45:28,999 --> 00:45:30,438
You're patched in.

588
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:34,597
All right, it's definitely an image.
Let's try and stabilize it.

589
00:45:38,478 --> 00:45:39,918
What do you make of that, Fish?

590
00:45:40,078 --> 00:45:43,358
It's two different interlaced frames.
I'm framing one.

591
00:45:46,598 --> 00:45:49,237
- It's just noise.
- Trying frame two.

592
00:45:49,957 --> 00:45:53,556
I've got an offset carrier here.
I think it's audio.

593
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:54,916
Plug it in, plug it in.

594
00:45:59,077 --> 00:46:00,316
Center that segment.

595
00:46:00,477 --> 00:46:01,956
Centering.

596
00:46:05,677 --> 00:46:08,515
- Can you clean it up any more than that?
- I'm working on it.

597
00:46:20,996 --> 00:46:22,275
What the hell...?

598
00:46:23,076 --> 00:46:24,195
Try zooming out.

599
00:46:27,916 --> 00:46:28,994
All right, freeze.

600
00:46:29,155 --> 00:46:30,434
Reverse values.

601
00:46:32,035 --> 00:46:34,074
Try zooming out again.

602
00:46:37,515 --> 00:46:39,554
Rotate 90 degrees counterclock...

603
00:46:40,994 --> 00:46:42,874
My God.

604
00:46:47,713 --> 00:46:50,552
- Okay.
- What's going on?

605
00:46:50,712 --> 00:46:53,272
You're not gonna believe this.

606
00:47:06,152 --> 00:47:07,831
Does anybody speak German?

607
00:47:09,192 --> 00:47:11,511
"I declare the Games in Berlin..."

608
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:14,230
"...at the celebration..."

609
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:18,630
"...of the first Olympics of the new era
has opened."

610
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,349
Get me the White House.

611
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:33,549
Twenty million people died
defeating that son of a bitch...

612
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:35,828
...and he's our first ambassador
to outer space?

613
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:38,229
- Actually...
- The broadcast from the '36 Olympics...

614
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:41,269
...was the first television transmission
that went into space.

615
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:44,668
That they recorded it and sent it back
is saying, "Hello, we heard you."

616
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:47,188
Or, "Sjeg Heil, you're our kind of people."

617
00:47:47,389 --> 00:47:49,947
Wait. Hitler and his politics
have nothing to do with this.

618
00:47:50,108 --> 00:47:53,468
It's highly unlikely they would understand,
and people need to understand...

619
00:47:53,629 --> 00:47:55,707
The people are in very good hands,
Dr. Arroway.

620
00:47:55,868 --> 00:47:56,827
We'll take it from here.

621
00:47:56,988 --> 00:47:58,988
The White House has just released...

622
00:47:59,148 --> 00:48:00,187
Smile, folks.
We're on.

623
00:48:00,348 --> 00:48:03,147
- A statement confirming a message
from deep space...

624
00:48:03,308 --> 00:48:07,225
...has been received by American scientists.
Claire Shipman is at the White House.

625
00:48:07,386 --> 00:48:10,425
Donna, we've been told the president
will have only a few remarks...

626
00:48:10,627 --> 00:48:12,025
...about today's announcement...

627
00:48:12,186 --> 00:48:15,465
...and that he won't be taking
any questions from the press.

628
00:48:20,226 --> 00:48:21,504
Good afternoon.

629
00:48:24,265 --> 00:48:28,304
I'm glad to be joined by my
science and technology advisor.

630
00:48:30,065 --> 00:48:32,784
This is the product
of years of exploration...

631
00:48:32,985 --> 00:48:36,063
...by some of the world's
most distinguished scientists.

632
00:48:36,265 --> 00:48:40,303
Like all discoveries, this one
will and should continue to be reviewed...

633
00:48:40,504 --> 00:48:43,144
...examined and scrutinized.

634
00:48:43,344 --> 00:48:46,302
It must be confirmed by other scientists.

635
00:48:46,464 --> 00:48:52,023
The fact that something of this magnitude
is being explored is another...

636
00:48:52,184 --> 00:48:55,902
Fish, what is the story over here?
I thought Ellie was supposed to be on.

637
00:48:56,103 --> 00:48:57,543
I don't know.

638
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,981
Guys? Guys? Um...

639
00:49:01,743 --> 00:49:04,462
You know those interlaced frames
that we thought were noise?

640
00:49:05,262 --> 00:49:07,822
This has structure.
I'm hearing structure.

641
00:49:09,142 --> 00:49:11,301
If this discovery is confirmed...

642
00:49:11,502 --> 00:49:14,981
...it will be one of the most stunning
insights into our universe...

643
00:49:15,182 --> 00:49:17,141
...that science has ever uncovered.

644
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:22,581
Its implications are as far-reaching
and awe-inspiring as can be imagined.

645
00:49:22,781 --> 00:49:26,099
Even as it promises answers
to some of our oldest questions...

646
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,579
...it poses still others,
even more fundamental.

647
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:33,259
We will continue to listen closely
to what it has to say...

648
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:36,859
...as we continue the search for answers
and for knowledge...

649
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:42,498
...that is as old as humanity itself
but essential to our people's future.

650
00:49:42,819 --> 00:49:44,218
- Thank you.
- Sir...

651
00:49:44,379 --> 00:49:46,418
Is there a considerable
global security threat?

652
00:49:46,579 --> 00:49:49,578
I'll answer your questions at the end,
but first a few corrections.

653
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:53,577
The message was received Friday morning,
6:31 a.m. Mountain Standard Time.

654
00:49:53,778 --> 00:49:58,177
It was largely mathematical, and in spite of
reports you may have seen to the contrary...

655
00:49:58,338 --> 00:50:00,777
...appears to be completely benign
in nature.

656
00:50:00,978 --> 00:50:04,577
Let me say that again.
The message is completely benign.

657
00:50:04,738 --> 00:50:08,096
The president has been in touch
with heads of state from around the world...

658
00:50:08,257 --> 00:50:10,897
...and every possible security measure
is being taken.

659
00:50:11,057 --> 00:50:13,976
To better explain to you
the events of the last 48 hours...

660
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:18,416
...l'm turning you over to the leader of the
team that made this remarkable discovery...

661
00:50:18,577 --> 00:50:22,575
...Dr. David Drumlin,
special science advisor to the president.

662
00:50:30,176 --> 00:50:32,895
Thank you, Rachel. Hello.

663
00:50:34,736 --> 00:50:37,095
In 1936
a very faint television signal...

664
00:50:37,295 --> 00:50:40,255
...transmitted the opening ceremonies
of the Olympic Games...

665
00:50:40,415 --> 00:50:43,934
...as a show
of German superior technology.

666
00:50:44,974 --> 00:50:46,973
That signal left Earth
at the speed of light...

667
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:52,892
...and 26 years later arrived in the vicinity
of the star we call Vega.

668
00:50:53,773 --> 00:50:57,452
That signal has been sent back to us
hugely amplified...

669
00:50:57,613 --> 00:51:00,172
...an unmistakable sign of intelligence.

670
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:01,772
You're online, Kent, go ahead.

671
00:51:01,932 --> 00:51:05,972
The Adolf transmission used 25 frames
per second but we're receiving 50.

672
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:09,931
So we canned the other 25
through a series of search algorithms.

673
00:51:10,092 --> 00:51:12,531
We found a series of markers
on the top of each frame.

674
00:51:12,692 --> 00:51:14,331
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, go ahead.

675
00:51:14,492 --> 00:51:17,611
- Send it, Willie.
- Okay, here it comes.

676
00:51:20,731 --> 00:51:22,010
It's digital...

677
00:51:22,172 --> 00:51:26,250
...massive amounts of data which
extend right to the higher harmonics.

678
00:51:26,891 --> 00:51:28,570
Jackpot.

679
00:51:29,451 --> 00:51:31,289
All right, as you'll see...

680
00:51:31,451 --> 00:51:34,609
...interlaced with the frames
of the original Hitler image...

681
00:51:34,771 --> 00:51:37,609
...we found these sections.

682
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:41,129
Now, we thought they were just noise,
but they're actually data...

683
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:42,529
...huge amounts of it.

684
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:47,048
When we combine this with the data from
the amplification of the original signal...

685
00:51:47,209 --> 00:51:50,368
...we get these encrypted pages of text.

686
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:54,569
Now, no two are alike and
we've uncovered over 10,000 already.

687
00:51:54,729 --> 00:51:57,048
What does it mean, doctor?

688
00:51:57,209 --> 00:51:59,448
Well, we have no idea.
It could be anything.

689
00:51:59,609 --> 00:52:02,208
It could be the first volume
of an Encyclopedia Galactica.

690
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,166
Instructions to acquaint us
with their colonization procedures.

691
00:52:05,327 --> 00:52:07,206
Moses with a few billion
new commandments.

692
00:52:07,367 --> 00:52:09,566
How long will it take to decode it?

693
00:52:09,767 --> 00:52:12,966
It could take forever.
We really need a primer...

694
00:52:13,127 --> 00:52:16,086
We need to get the best
decryption people we have.

695
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:20,645
I intend to use the VLA
as my command post.

696
00:52:20,806 --> 00:52:24,085
In the meantime, my office
has made out a preliminary budget.

697
00:52:24,246 --> 00:52:28,045
Wait a minute.
This is a privately-funded operation.

698
00:52:28,246 --> 00:52:30,445
We're only leasing dish time
from the government...

699
00:52:30,646 --> 00:52:33,605
If there's a more clear case
of eminent domain, I've never seen it.

700
00:52:33,766 --> 00:52:36,245
I'm going to recommend
we militarize this project.

701
00:52:36,406 --> 00:52:38,684
What? This is my project.

702
00:52:38,845 --> 00:52:42,084
Nobody knows more about these scenarios
than I do. David, tell them...

703
00:52:42,245 --> 00:52:45,483
Excuse me, could we calm down here?

704
00:52:45,685 --> 00:52:50,163
Now, I'm going to recommend that
Dr. Drumlin coordinate the decryption effort.

705
00:52:50,324 --> 00:52:53,563
However, in light of Dr. Arroway's
long experience in these matters...

706
00:52:53,724 --> 00:52:57,763
...for the time being, she will continue
to direct operations at the VLA...

707
00:52:57,924 --> 00:53:02,403
...understanding that future discoveries
will be kept in strictest confidence...

708
00:53:02,564 --> 00:53:04,402
...until such time as the president...

709
00:53:04,563 --> 00:53:08,402
...can decide the most suitable
course of action. Understood?

710
00:53:08,563 --> 00:53:09,723
Yes.

711
00:53:10,004 --> 00:53:12,522
This is CNN Breaking News.

712
00:53:12,683 --> 00:53:15,521
The president made a statement,
calling the message from Vega...

713
00:53:15,723 --> 00:53:17,762
...one of the most stunning insights
into our...

714
00:53:17,962 --> 00:53:22,761
Attendance at religious services has
risen a dramatic 39 percent in recent days.

715
00:53:22,922 --> 00:53:26,600
...as police in three German divisions
clashed with neo-Nazi protesters.

716
00:53:26,761 --> 00:53:28,799
So it turns out
there's life on other planets.

717
00:53:29,001 --> 00:53:32,480
Boy, this is really gonna change
the Miss Universe contest.

718
00:53:33,121 --> 00:53:37,280
Health officials from around the world are
concerned that the message from Vega...

719
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,959
...might trigger a rash of mass suicides...

720
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,679
...not unlike the recent cult deaths
near San Diego...

721
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,759
Even a scientist has to admit...

722
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,278
...that there are some pretty serious
religious overtones to all this.

723
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,519
Let's hear from someone
whose organization...

724
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:54,159
...has been accused of conducting
its own inquisition:

725
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,838
Richard Rank,
head of the Conservative coalition.

726
00:53:56,999 --> 00:53:58,038
Thank you.

727
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:02,397
This is yet another example of science
intruding into matters of faith.

728
00:54:03,398 --> 00:54:06,557
This means they
have been reacting to TV signals...

729
00:54:06,759 --> 00:54:09,557
...they got from the 1930s.
They're just getting them.

730
00:54:09,758 --> 00:54:13,277
Imagine how disappointed
they're gonna be if they're Cubs fans.

731
00:54:13,438 --> 00:54:16,477
We now take you to Jeremy Roth,
who is reporting on events...

732
00:54:16,677 --> 00:54:19,996
...at the Very Large Array
near Socorro, New Mexico.

733
00:54:20,198 --> 00:54:21,956
Like a bolt from the blue it came.

734
00:54:22,118 --> 00:54:26,116
The message from Vega has caused
thousands of believers and non-believers...

735
00:54:26,277 --> 00:54:30,036
...to descend upon the VLA facility
here in the desert of New Mexico.

736
00:54:30,236 --> 00:54:32,636
Many have come to protest,
many to pray...

737
00:54:32,797 --> 00:54:37,435
...but most have come to participate
in what has become the best show in town.

738
00:55:34,991 --> 00:55:40,630
That's right. I'll be there in Vega,
thank you very much.

739
00:55:43,511 --> 00:55:46,310
Hajl to Vega
Hail to Vega, Hail to Vega

740
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:49,590
Hail to Vega

741
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:52,469
But they have failed!

742
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:55,469
It's the same people who,
again and again...

743
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:57,949
...have brought us
to the brink of destruction.

744
00:55:58,149 --> 00:56:02,028
Who've polluted our air,
who've poisoned our water.

745
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:05,109
Now these scientists...

746
00:56:06,069 --> 00:56:07,827
...have had their chance.

747
00:56:07,988 --> 00:56:11,267
Are these the kind of people...

748
00:56:11,428 --> 00:56:14,427
...that you want
talking to your God for you?

749
00:56:18,707 --> 00:56:20,706
Efforts continue around the clock.

750
00:56:21,028 --> 00:56:24,466
But for now, almost 2 full weeks
after the message's arrival...

751
00:56:24,627 --> 00:56:27,666
...scientists here at the VLA
still have no answers...

752
00:56:27,827 --> 00:56:29,506
...only more questions.

753
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:33,226
Jeremy Roth, CNN,
Soccorro, New Mexico.

754
00:56:33,386 --> 00:56:36,585
More on the quest
for the message's meaning, after this.

755
00:56:39,306 --> 00:56:40,985
They gotta line up somehow.

756
00:56:41,146 --> 00:56:43,025
Yeah, well, this one doesn't fit, either.

757
00:56:43,186 --> 00:56:45,744
We've tried over a million permutations.

758
00:56:45,905 --> 00:56:49,265
Always, I can only get
three corners to fit.

759
00:56:50,226 --> 00:56:52,264
I don't understand their significance.

760
00:57:32,422 --> 00:57:35,020
What...? Somebody broke in...

761
00:57:41,101 --> 00:57:42,219
Hello?

762
00:57:43,101 --> 00:57:46,379
Hey, listen, I don't know who you are,
but you broke into the database...

763
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,739
What? Now?

764
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,219
Where?

765
00:58:06,699 --> 00:58:08,058
I'll be there.

766
00:58:34,537 --> 00:58:35,817
You should feel fortunate.

767
00:58:36,537 --> 00:58:37,976
He hardly lands for anyone.

768
00:59:08,254 --> 00:59:10,133
Dr. Arroway...

769
00:59:13,894 --> 00:59:15,173
...I presume?

770
00:59:16,414 --> 00:59:17,493
Mr. Hadden.

771
00:59:18,734 --> 00:59:21,852
I've had my eye on you
a long time, doctor.

772
00:59:22,613 --> 00:59:25,972
I consider you one of my
most valuable long-term investments.

773
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:30,051
And when it comes to my investments...

774
00:59:31,773 --> 00:59:34,331
...I always do my homework.

775
00:59:38,852 --> 00:59:40,531
Eleanor Ann Arroway...

776
00:59:40,732 --> 00:59:43,131
...born 25th August, 1964...

777
00:59:43,331 --> 00:59:44,850
...De Pere, Wisconsin.

778
00:59:45,052 --> 00:59:49,090
Mother, Joanna, died
from complications during childbirth.

779
00:59:49,771 --> 00:59:52,370
Early testing indicated
high predisposition...

780
00:59:52,531 --> 00:59:55,490
...towards science and mathematics.

781
00:59:56,131 --> 00:59:57,250
Father, Theodore...

782
00:59:57,411 --> 01:00:00,810
...advised to provide
enrichment activities along these lines...

783
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:03,649
...did so conscientiously
until his death...

784
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:08,288
...from myocardial infarction,
November 10, 1974.

785
01:00:08,849 --> 01:00:11,967
You graduated from
high school in 1979...

786
01:00:12,128 --> 01:00:14,167
...almost two full years early.

787
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:19,727
Awarded full scholarship, M.I. T,
graduated magna cum laude.

788
01:00:20,648 --> 01:00:22,287
Doctoral work, Cal Tech...

789
01:00:22,488 --> 01:00:25,686
...where you did breakthrough work
on the lanthanide-doped ruby maser...

790
01:00:25,847 --> 01:00:29,806
...dramatically increasing
the sensitivity of radio telescopes.

791
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:33,686
Subsequently offered a teaching position
at Harvard University...

792
01:00:33,888 --> 01:00:36,846
...which you turned down
to pursue SETI work...

793
01:00:37,047 --> 01:00:40,326
...at the Arecibo Observatory
in Puerto Rico.

794
01:00:42,647 --> 01:00:48,262
Changes in NSF policy
gave rise to certain funding problems...

795
01:00:49,686 --> 01:00:53,524
...at which point
you came to my attention.

796
01:00:54,806 --> 01:00:56,925
You compromised our security codes.

797
01:00:59,285 --> 01:01:01,045
Once upon a time...

798
01:01:02,966 --> 01:01:05,124
...I was a hell of an engineer.

799
01:01:05,285 --> 01:01:07,604
Please, sit, doctor.

800
01:01:07,765 --> 01:01:12,684
I have guests so rarely, it's important to me
that they feel welcome in my home.

801
01:01:13,245 --> 01:01:14,923
You live here?

802
01:01:16,084 --> 01:01:19,284
I find it convenient
to keep my interests...

803
01:01:20,404 --> 01:01:21,483
...mobile.

804
01:01:23,963 --> 01:01:28,682
Anyway, I've had my fill
of life on the ground.

805
01:01:29,163 --> 01:01:31,202
Well, I... I guess I should...

806
01:01:31,642 --> 01:01:35,281
Well, I guess I should thank you
for having bailed me out all that time.

807
01:01:40,402 --> 01:01:42,441
I know a good bet when I see one.

808
01:01:44,721 --> 01:01:47,801
Earl Grey. No sugar, no milk, I believe.

809
01:01:50,641 --> 01:01:52,400
What am I doing here?

810
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,319
The powers that be
have been very busy lately...

811
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:11,239
...falling over each other to position
themselves for the game of the millennium.

812
01:02:17,239 --> 01:02:19,918
Maybe I can help deal you back in.

813
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,438
I didn't realize that I was out.

814
01:02:23,919 --> 01:02:26,117
No, maybe not out...

815
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:28,997
...but certainly being handed your hat.

816
01:02:34,198 --> 01:02:37,717
I've had a long time
to make enemies, doctor.

817
01:02:41,158 --> 01:02:44,837
And there are many governments,
business interests...

818
01:02:44,998 --> 01:02:48,836
...even religious leaders that
would like to see me depart this earth.

819
01:02:50,236 --> 01:02:52,675
And I'll grant them their wish
soon enough.

820
01:02:53,196 --> 01:02:56,595
But before I do,
I wish to make a small contribution.

821
01:02:57,316 --> 01:03:01,715
A final gesture of goodwill to the people
of this little planet that have given...

822
01:03:04,395 --> 01:03:07,074
From whom I have taken so much.

823
01:03:10,394 --> 01:03:11,793
You found the primer.

824
01:03:14,114 --> 01:03:15,913
Clever girl.

825
01:03:16,074 --> 01:03:17,074
Lights.

826
01:03:25,314 --> 01:03:28,352
Pages and pages of data.

827
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:31,512
Over 63,000 in all.

828
01:03:31,673 --> 01:03:33,672
And on the perimeter of each...

829
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:37,312
Alignment symbols, a registration mark,
but they don't line up.

830
01:03:37,873 --> 01:03:40,912
They do, if you think like a Vegan.

831
01:03:41,792 --> 01:03:44,671
An alien intelligence
has got be more advanced...

832
01:03:44,832 --> 01:03:48,751
...and that means efficiency
functioning on multiple levels...

833
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:52,591
...and in multiple dimensions.

834
01:03:56,392 --> 01:03:58,710
Yes, of course!

835
01:03:58,872 --> 01:03:59,871
Where's the primer?

836
01:04:00,351 --> 01:04:01,710
You'll see.

837
01:04:02,191 --> 01:04:06,469
Every three-dimensional page
contains a piece of the primer.

838
01:04:08,549 --> 01:04:11,909
There it was all the time,
staring you in the face.

839
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:16,708
Buried within the message itself
is the key to decoding it.

840
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:19,988
Within the layering of the matrix,
we have these basic equations:

841
01:04:21,869 --> 01:04:25,748
So with this very elementary foundation,
they have given us a kind of...

842
01:04:25,909 --> 01:04:28,388
...general scientific vocabulary.

843
01:04:28,588 --> 01:04:30,787
We now have the symbols
for true and false...

844
01:04:30,989 --> 01:04:32,228
This was the key...

845
01:04:32,388 --> 01:04:34,787
...that allowed us
to decipher their language...

846
01:04:34,987 --> 01:04:38,507
...for physics, geometry, chemistry.
Next frame, Ellie.

847
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:43,467
Yes, and when we apply this
to the rest of the message...

848
01:04:44,187 --> 01:04:45,226
...we find this.

849
01:04:49,627 --> 01:04:52,426
Those look like engineering schematics,
almost like blueprints.

850
01:04:52,587 --> 01:04:54,146
Yeah.

851
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:55,346
Yes.

852
01:04:55,507 --> 01:04:58,666
It is our belief that
the message contains instructions...

853
01:04:58,866 --> 01:05:02,185
...for building something,
some kind of machine.

854
01:05:02,346 --> 01:05:05,345
A machine? That does what, doctor?

855
01:05:05,506 --> 01:05:07,624
We don't know.
It might be some type...

856
01:05:08,546 --> 01:05:13,864
...of advanced communication device,
or a teaching machine of some kind.

857
01:05:14,345 --> 01:05:17,504
Or it might turn out to be
some kind of a transport.

858
01:05:17,905 --> 01:05:20,264
- Transport?
- There's no proof of that.

859
01:05:20,425 --> 01:05:24,103
The fact is, you don't know what it does.
It could be anything.

860
01:05:24,264 --> 01:05:27,463
Could be a Trojan horse. We build it
and out pours the entire Vegan army.

861
01:05:27,624 --> 01:05:30,182
Why bother risking the personnel?
It could be a weapon.

862
01:05:30,383 --> 01:05:32,582
Right. Some kind of
a doomsday machine.

863
01:05:32,743 --> 01:05:35,142
Exactly. Every time they detect
a new civilization...

864
01:05:35,303 --> 01:05:37,661
...they fax these construction documents
from space.

865
01:05:37,822 --> 01:05:41,302
We poor saps build whatever this is
and blow ourselves to kingdom come.

866
01:05:41,463 --> 01:05:44,261
There's no reason to believe
that their intentions are hostile.

867
01:05:44,422 --> 01:05:48,581
Why is the default position of the egghead
set that aliens would always be benign?

868
01:05:48,742 --> 01:05:51,100
- Why is that, doctor?
- We pose no threat to them.

869
01:05:51,262 --> 01:05:55,500
It would be like us going out of our way
to destroy microbes on an anthill in Africa

870
01:05:55,661 --> 01:05:57,180
That's an interesting analogy.

871
01:05:57,581 --> 01:06:01,580
And how guilty would we feel if we
destroyed a few microbes on an anthill?

872
01:06:01,741 --> 01:06:04,020
I hope you're right, doctor. I really do.

873
01:06:04,181 --> 01:06:07,500
But right now my job is to protect
American lives from any threat.

874
01:06:07,661 --> 01:06:09,899
In that regard, I am obligated
to assume the worst.

875
01:06:10,141 --> 01:06:12,139
Well, yes, and I am forced
to agree with you.

876
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:13,659
My problem is this:

877
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:17,339
The content of that message
is morally ambiguous at best.

878
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:21,379
Now, our internal numbers show
support for this is incredibly soft.

879
01:06:21,539 --> 01:06:24,099
If the president wishes
to stay this course...

880
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:26,818
...you're gonna find his numbers
going south like a duck.

881
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:29,298
- This is nuts.
- Excuse me...

882
01:06:29,459 --> 01:06:30,818
...miss.

883
01:06:30,979 --> 01:06:33,258
We know nothing
of these creatures' values.

884
01:06:33,419 --> 01:06:36,098
The fact is, we don't even know
whether they believe in God.

885
01:06:36,259 --> 01:06:39,858
- This doesn't make any sense. If you...
- Excuse me, Dr. Arroway.

886
01:06:40,058 --> 01:06:42,417
We won't be suppressing
any opinions here today.

887
01:06:43,258 --> 01:06:45,857
No, of course not.
I understand.

888
01:06:46,258 --> 01:06:48,096
What I meant to say...

889
01:06:48,257 --> 01:06:51,575
...is the message was written
in the language of science.

890
01:06:51,736 --> 01:06:54,976
Now, if it had been religious in nature,
it should have taken the form...

891
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:57,655
...of a burning bush
or a booming voice from the sky.

892
01:06:57,857 --> 01:06:59,855
But a voice from the sky...

893
01:07:00,896 --> 01:07:03,615
...is exactly what you found,
Doctor Arroway.

894
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,734
I'm sorry I'm late, ma'am.

895
01:07:08,895 --> 01:07:13,895
Now, I agree with Mr. Rank
that there are unavoidable...

896
01:07:14,095 --> 01:07:16,174
...religious implications at stake here.

897
01:07:16,335 --> 01:07:18,654
But that doesn't justify
taking an alarmist position.

898
01:07:20,615 --> 01:07:23,253
My hope here is that we can find
a common ground...

899
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:26,013
...break through any obstacles
that may have kept us apart.

900
01:07:26,174 --> 01:07:29,453
- Well, perhaps...
- Listen, I need to make one thing very clear.

901
01:07:29,654 --> 01:07:34,093
Our organization will not be placated
with flowery New Age rhetoric...

902
01:07:35,053 --> 01:07:36,493
Mr. President.

903
01:07:37,894 --> 01:07:40,093
The President met
with his top advisors today...

904
01:07:40,253 --> 01:07:43,533
...regarding the latest efforts
to decode the message.

905
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:48,172
While there has been some progress,
the official line remains a cautious one.

906
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:52,771
If you're asking when we'll find out
what the purpose of that machine is...

907
01:07:53,732 --> 01:07:56,331
...maybe tomorrow,
maybe next year, maybe never.

908
01:08:00,572 --> 01:08:04,971
There he is. The man with his finger
on the spiritual pulse of the nation.

909
01:08:06,292 --> 01:08:09,570
- It's so good to see you, Ellie.
- You too.

910
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:14,569
Your discovery, all of this.
It must be a real vindication.

911
01:08:15,211 --> 01:08:16,809
I'm really happy for you.

912
01:08:17,409 --> 01:08:21,209
- Are you?
- Mr. Joss, the president is waiting.

913
01:08:22,529 --> 01:08:25,528
- Okay. Yeah.
- The president is waiting.

914
01:08:29,289 --> 01:08:33,008
- Ellie, see you at the reception tonight?
- Yeah, I wouldn't miss it.

915
01:08:33,169 --> 01:08:34,967
All right, great.

916
01:08:44,568 --> 01:08:46,807
Excuse me, Miss Constantine,
may I speak to you?

917
01:08:46,968 --> 01:08:48,327
Certainly.

918
01:08:50,008 --> 01:08:52,126
- I have a big problem.
- Yes?

919
01:08:52,287 --> 01:08:53,727
Um...

920
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:56,566
Do you know where I can find,
like, a really great dress?

921
01:09:12,566 --> 01:09:18,645
God created man in the form of himself,
not in the form of monkeys!

922
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,485
- The Lord is God!
- Praise God.

923
01:09:22,646 --> 01:09:26,684
- Praise the Lord!
- You're wasting my tax dollars!

924
01:09:27,445 --> 01:09:30,923
Get a job.
Don't waste my tax dollars.

925
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:32,763
You hear me?

926
01:09:50,962 --> 01:09:52,682
Wow.

927
01:09:55,122 --> 01:09:56,721
You look beautiful, Ellie.

928
01:09:58,322 --> 01:10:00,561
- So do you.
- You really do.

929
01:10:04,082 --> 01:10:05,480
I read your book.

930
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:07,840
Here we go.

931
01:10:08,001 --> 01:10:10,000
Would you like me to quote you?

932
01:10:10,161 --> 01:10:14,960
"Ironically, the thing that people
are most hungry for, meaning...

933
01:10:15,121 --> 01:10:18,320
...is the one thing that science
hasn't been able to give them."

934
01:10:18,481 --> 01:10:21,239
Yeah. Yeah.

935
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:26,440
Come on. It's like you're saying
that science killed God.

936
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,679
What if science simply revealed...

937
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,239
...that he never existed
in the first place?

938
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,479
- I think we're gonna need to get some air.
- What?

939
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,399
And a few more of these.

940
01:10:41,759 --> 01:10:43,918
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

941
01:10:44,879 --> 01:10:47,918
- A little chilly out here.
- Yeah, this is nice.

942
01:10:48,079 --> 01:10:49,397
- I got one for you.
- What?

943
01:10:49,558 --> 01:10:51,237
Occam's razor.
Ever heard of it?

944
01:10:51,437 --> 01:10:53,997
Hoccam's razor.
Sounds like some slasher movie.

945
01:10:54,157 --> 01:10:57,596
No, Occam's Razor.
It's a basic scientific principle. It says...

946
01:10:57,757 --> 01:11:01,196
...all things being equal, the simplest
explanation tends to be the right one.

947
01:11:01,357 --> 01:11:02,916
- Makes sense to me.
- All right.

948
01:11:03,076 --> 01:11:05,756
- So, what's more likely? Thank you.
- You're welcome.

949
01:11:05,917 --> 01:11:08,435
An all-powerful, mysterious God
created the universe...

950
01:11:08,637 --> 01:11:11,355
...and then decided not to give
any proof of his existence?

951
01:11:11,516 --> 01:11:16,155
Or that he simply doesn't exist at all
and that we created him...

952
01:11:16,316 --> 01:11:18,714
...so we wouldn't have to feel
so small and alone.

953
01:11:19,596 --> 01:11:20,794
I don't know.

954
01:11:20,956 --> 01:11:24,794
I couldn't imagine living in a world
where God didn't exist.

955
01:11:25,435 --> 01:11:27,034
I wouldn't want to.

956
01:11:27,675 --> 01:11:29,994
How do you know that
you're not deluding yourself?

957
01:11:30,634 --> 01:11:33,754
I mean, for me, I'd need proof.

958
01:11:34,555 --> 01:11:35,993
Proof?

959
01:11:38,754 --> 01:11:41,153
- Did you love your father?
- What?

960
01:11:41,315 --> 01:11:43,033
Your dad, did you love him?

961
01:11:43,994 --> 01:11:46,713
Yes. Very much.

962
01:11:49,433 --> 01:11:50,913
Prove it.

963
01:11:57,153 --> 01:11:58,152
Kent.

964
01:11:59,432 --> 01:12:02,311
- The White House.
- Mr. Joss.

965
01:12:03,432 --> 01:12:06,272
I don't want excuses.
Whoever is responsible, I want their head.

966
01:12:06,432 --> 01:12:09,271
- Ellie?
- What happened?

967
01:12:09,432 --> 01:12:10,791
You were right all along.

968
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:13,950
The decryption team at the VLA
has been working around the clock...

969
01:12:14,111 --> 01:12:16,709
...and the hard work has finally paid off.

970
01:12:16,871 --> 01:12:20,670
This key section, uncovered tonight
and obtained exclusively by CNN...

971
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:23,349
...shows an illustration
of what is of a human figure...

972
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:26,229
...inside a geometric structure
of some kind.

973
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:28,149
This and other contextual clues...

974
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:31,269
...now lead scientists to believe
that the message is, in fact...

975
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:34,828
- President called an emergency meeting.
- Yeah, I imagine he would.

976
01:12:34,989 --> 01:12:37,988
- Designed to take
a single human occupant into space...

977
01:12:38,149 --> 01:12:40,708
...presumably to the star Vega.

978
01:12:58,468 --> 01:13:00,347
I'm gonna miss
my mother's birthday party.

979
01:13:00,508 --> 01:13:03,267
Call her in the morning,
tell her why you didn't show up.

980
01:13:03,428 --> 01:13:04,866
Tell me.

981
01:13:05,027 --> 01:13:06,106
They're gonna build it.

982
01:13:06,267 --> 01:13:07,267
Who gets to go?

983
01:13:07,428 --> 01:13:10,626
The president's just gone international
to spread the risk and cost...

984
01:13:10,787 --> 01:13:12,266
Who gets to go, though?

985
01:13:12,427 --> 01:13:13,986
Well, it's complicated, Ellie.

986
01:13:14,866 --> 01:13:15,866
What?

987
01:13:16,027 --> 01:13:18,746
They have formed a group
of international candidates.

988
01:13:18,907 --> 01:13:20,866
Now, it's your discovery.

989
01:13:21,267 --> 01:13:24,986
Okay, they understand that.
You're at the top of a very short list.

990
01:13:25,146 --> 01:13:27,585
But they're also putting together
a selection committee.

991
01:13:27,746 --> 01:13:31,744
It's made of scholars, theologians,
scientists, philosophers...

992
01:13:31,905 --> 01:13:32,864
You're on it.

993
01:13:34,025 --> 01:13:35,264
I've been asked, yes.

994
01:13:38,104 --> 01:13:39,703
I guess that means...

995
01:13:40,264 --> 01:13:42,903
...that you're a selector,
I'm a selectee and we can't...

996
01:13:43,064 --> 01:13:44,343
Yeah.

997
01:13:44,504 --> 01:13:46,822
What you don't understand, Ellie, is...

998
01:13:46,984 --> 01:13:49,022
- I understand.
- Ellie...

999
01:13:49,624 --> 01:13:53,783
I want you to know, whatever happens,
as far as I'm concerned...

1000
01:13:54,343 --> 01:13:55,782
Well...

1001
01:13:56,903 --> 01:13:58,422
...good luck.

1002
01:14:02,263 --> 01:14:05,582
Well, whatever you do, make sure
he doesn't monopolize the committee.

1003
01:14:05,742 --> 01:14:07,742
He is not on the committee, Ellie.

1004
01:14:09,423 --> 01:14:10,781
What?

1005
01:14:11,542 --> 01:14:14,461
He just resigned as science advisor.
He wants to be the one to go.

1006
01:14:16,581 --> 01:14:19,740
The president is already
beginning to feel the financial pinch.

1007
01:14:20,021 --> 01:14:22,021
Sources say the cost of the project...

1008
01:14:22,181 --> 01:14:25,660
...is spiraling
to more than a third of a trillion dollars...

1009
01:14:25,821 --> 01:14:29,260
...making this what may be
the most expensive single project...

1010
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:31,259
...in all of human history.

1011
01:14:31,461 --> 01:14:34,659
Meanwhile, months of debate finally
reached a conclusion last week...

1012
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:37,819
...as 10 candidates
were selected by the IMC...

1013
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:41,779
...representing a cross section of
political, philosophical and religious views.

1014
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:44,739
Many of these are the same experts
who have been consulting...

1015
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:46,859
...on the Machine's design and function.

1016
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:51,098
They will be actively participating on-site
during the construction process.

1017
01:14:51,258 --> 01:14:54,457
But the choice of these 10 candidates
has not been without controversy.

1018
01:14:54,618 --> 01:14:57,337
Fully one-third of the candidates
are American.

1019
01:14:57,498 --> 01:15:00,137
Many international observers
are asking why.

1020
01:15:00,298 --> 01:15:03,297
The U.S. Is shouldering an
enormous percentage of the financial...

1021
01:15:03,497 --> 01:15:06,336
Isn't it true that the contractors,
like Hadden Industries...

1022
01:15:06,537 --> 01:15:09,736
...are making those contributions
in exchange for technology rights?

1023
01:15:09,937 --> 01:15:13,296
Different nations are being compensated
in different ways. For example...

1024
01:15:13,457 --> 01:15:17,816
Japan made headlines when it announced it
would forego candidate representation...

1025
01:15:17,977 --> 01:15:21,055
...in exchange for the systems integration
subcontract.

1026
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:25,975
On what basis do you choose
a human being to represent humanity?

1027
01:15:26,176 --> 01:15:27,335
Good question, Larry.

1028
01:15:27,496 --> 01:15:29,374
Yes, well, if nothing else...

1029
01:15:29,535 --> 01:15:33,374
...it should be somebody who is fluent in
the language the message was given in.

1030
01:15:33,535 --> 01:15:34,695
Science, in this case.

1031
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:37,614
Doctor Arroway,
despite your obvious enthusiasm...

1032
01:15:37,815 --> 01:15:39,934
...there's been a lot of criticism of late...

1033
01:15:40,175 --> 01:15:42,574
...that this whole endeavor
is simply too dangerous.

1034
01:15:42,735 --> 01:15:45,214
Some of that criticism from scientists.

1035
01:15:45,415 --> 01:15:48,094
One Nobel Prize winner recently noted,
his words:

1036
01:15:48,854 --> 01:15:50,493
"There is every indication...

1037
01:15:50,694 --> 01:15:54,333
"...that this is simply beyond our
capabilities, that this endeavor will fail..."

1038
01:15:54,534 --> 01:15:58,013
"...and that the Machine's occupant
will pay for that failure with their life."

1039
01:15:58,173 --> 01:15:59,773
How do you respond to that?

1040
01:15:59,973 --> 01:16:03,213
Well, this message is from
a civilization that may be anywhere...

1041
01:16:03,413 --> 01:16:06,972
...from hundreds to millions
and millions of years ahead of us.

1042
01:16:07,214 --> 01:16:10,251
I have to believe that
an intelligence that advanced...

1043
01:16:10,852 --> 01:16:12,771
...knows what they're doing.

1044
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:17,451
Now all it requires on our part is...

1045
01:16:17,612 --> 01:16:18,610
Faith?

1046
01:16:21,571 --> 01:16:23,570
I was gonna say a sense of adventure.

1047
01:16:23,771 --> 01:16:24,930
And in breaking news...

1048
01:16:25,491 --> 01:16:26,730
...a former astronaut...

1049
01:16:26,931 --> 01:16:30,610
...considered to be the leading American
candidate for the Machine seat...

1050
01:16:30,810 --> 01:16:33,009
...has unexpectedly dropped out
of the running.

1051
01:16:33,411 --> 01:16:36,369
Russell met with reporters this afternoon
at his Houston home.

1052
01:16:36,691 --> 01:16:40,489
I told my dad
that I didn't want him to go.

1053
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:42,328
Daddy, don't go.

1054
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:47,848
Nothing would give me more pride
than to...

1055
01:16:48,490 --> 01:16:50,409
...represent my country.

1056
01:16:50,569 --> 01:16:52,688
But what can I say to this?

1057
01:16:53,249 --> 01:16:56,928
Consortium officials had no comment,
but sources within the delegation...

1058
01:16:57,089 --> 01:16:59,008
...have disclosed that Dr. Arroway...

1059
01:16:59,169 --> 01:17:03,087
...appears to now be the front-runner
for the Machine seat.

1060
01:17:03,888 --> 01:17:06,168
"Meet me at noon. Must talk."

1061
01:17:06,328 --> 01:17:08,967
I didn't expect to be getting
a message like this from you.

1062
01:17:09,128 --> 01:17:10,287
Thanks for coming.

1063
01:17:10,488 --> 01:17:13,326
So is this kosher?
Fraternizing with the enemy?

1064
01:17:13,487 --> 01:17:16,847
Selectors and selectees mingling around?

1065
01:17:17,008 --> 01:17:19,086
Can we talk about Einstein?

1066
01:17:19,247 --> 01:17:21,326
Yeah, sure. Okay.

1067
01:17:21,487 --> 01:17:22,846
- Special relativity.
- Yeah.

1068
01:17:23,007 --> 01:17:24,566
This machine...

1069
01:17:25,127 --> 01:17:29,845
...now, if it works, and you travel to Vega
at even close to the speed of light...

1070
01:17:30,006 --> 01:17:32,404
...when you come back...
- If you come back.

1071
01:17:34,485 --> 01:17:36,404
If you come back...

1072
01:17:36,565 --> 01:17:40,684
...you'll only be 4 years older, but over
50 years would have passed here on Earth.

1073
01:17:40,845 --> 01:17:42,484
Basically, yeah.

1074
01:17:42,964 --> 01:17:45,443
And everybody that you care about...

1075
01:17:46,284 --> 01:17:48,524
...will be gone, dead and buried.

1076
01:17:49,324 --> 01:17:53,163
If you came back,
if you survived at all, which...

1077
01:17:54,444 --> 01:17:58,003
Look, Palmer, nobody's saying
this isn't dangerous, all right?

1078
01:17:58,163 --> 01:18:02,123
The rest of the candidates and myself,
we fully understand the risks we're taking.

1079
01:18:02,283 --> 01:18:03,483
Why?

1080
01:18:03,644 --> 01:18:06,243
Because it's a historic opportunity.
The world needs...

1081
01:18:06,443 --> 01:18:08,962
No, you, Ellie.
You. You personally.

1082
01:18:09,963 --> 01:18:12,642
By doing this,
you're willing to give your life.

1083
01:18:12,842 --> 01:18:14,921
You're willing to die for it.

1084
01:18:16,682 --> 01:18:17,921
Why?

1085
01:18:21,482 --> 01:18:25,041
From as long as I can remember,
I've been searching for...

1086
01:18:25,642 --> 01:18:27,240
...something...

1087
01:18:27,442 --> 01:18:31,080
...some reason why we're here.
What are we doing here? Who are we?

1088
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:35,760
If this is a chance to find out
even just a little part of that answer...

1089
01:18:37,201 --> 01:18:40,080
I don't know,
I think it's won'th a human life.

1090
01:18:40,721 --> 01:18:42,199
Don't you?

1091
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,958
You're an incredibly brave woman, Ellie.

1092
01:18:53,639 --> 01:18:55,678
Or incredibly nuts.

1093
01:19:16,838 --> 01:19:18,276
Palmer...

1094
01:19:23,757 --> 01:19:25,756
I'm really confused.

1095
01:19:26,997 --> 01:19:28,196
So am I.

1096
01:19:29,396 --> 01:19:32,835
I think I speak for us all
when I thank you for your patience.

1097
01:19:33,037 --> 01:19:36,355
Myself, I have one final question,
Dr. Arroway.

1098
01:19:37,796 --> 01:19:40,035
If you should meet these Vegans...

1099
01:19:40,236 --> 01:19:44,355
...and were permitted only
one question to ask of them...

1100
01:19:44,516 --> 01:19:46,114
...what would it be?

1101
01:19:47,515 --> 01:19:49,474
Well, I suppose it would be:

1102
01:19:49,636 --> 01:19:51,234
"How did you do it?"

1103
01:19:51,755 --> 01:19:56,034
"How did you evolve? How did you
survive this technological adolescence..."

1104
01:19:56,195 --> 01:19:58,033
"...without destroying yourself?"

1105
01:19:58,754 --> 01:20:03,433
That more than any other question is one
I personally would like to have answered.

1106
01:20:03,755 --> 01:20:05,513
Not too bad, Mike.

1107
01:20:06,154 --> 01:20:07,393
I join Dr. Bergeron...

1108
01:20:07,554 --> 01:20:10,872
...in expressing thanks for
your patience, Dr. Arroway.

1109
01:20:11,073 --> 01:20:13,472
We've all been most impressed
with your candor...

1110
01:20:13,633 --> 01:20:15,591
...and your stamina.

1111
01:20:15,752 --> 01:20:18,791
I believe we are ready to move on
to your final statement.

1112
01:20:18,952 --> 01:20:20,791
Madam Chairman,
I have one more question.

1113
01:20:20,952 --> 01:20:22,631
Yes, Mr. Joss.

1114
01:20:23,232 --> 01:20:25,151
Dr. Arroway...

1115
01:20:26,472 --> 01:20:28,711
Would you consider yourself...

1116
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:31,711
...a spiritual person?

1117
01:20:34,271 --> 01:20:35,950
Uh...

1118
01:20:36,671 --> 01:20:39,870
I don't really understand
the point of the question.

1119
01:20:40,031 --> 01:20:42,790
I consider myself a moral person.

1120
01:20:42,951 --> 01:20:44,829
I'm sure we all agree that is the case...

1121
01:20:44,991 --> 01:20:47,389
...but I think what Mr. Joss
is in fact asking...

1122
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:49,309
Do you believe in God...

1123
01:20:51,230 --> 01:20:53,149
...Dr. Arroway?

1124
01:20:57,470 --> 01:20:59,789
As a scientist...

1125
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:03,269
...I rely on empirical evidence,
and in this matter...

1126
01:21:03,429 --> 01:21:06,989
...I don't believe
that there is data either way.

1127
01:21:07,549 --> 01:21:11,788
So your answer would in fact be
that you don't believe in God.

1128
01:21:15,069 --> 01:21:17,987
I don't understand the relevance
of the question.

1129
01:21:18,668 --> 01:21:23,586
Dr. Arroway,
95 percent of the world's population...

1130
01:21:23,748 --> 01:21:27,547
...believes in a supreme being
in one form or another.

1131
01:21:28,667 --> 01:21:31,745
I believe that makes the question
more than relevant.

1132
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:35,945
Dr. Arroway?

1133
01:21:45,465 --> 01:21:47,384
I believe, um...

1134
01:21:51,225 --> 01:21:53,623
I believe I've already
answered that question.

1135
01:21:57,504 --> 01:22:00,864
I'm proud of what
we've achieved as a species...

1136
01:22:01,024 --> 01:22:02,943
...and as a civilization.

1137
01:22:04,544 --> 01:22:06,943
I would hate to see
everything we stand for...

1138
01:22:07,104 --> 01:22:10,863
...all that we have fought for
for a thousand generations...

1139
01:22:11,063 --> 01:22:13,303
...all that God has blessed us with...

1140
01:22:14,584 --> 01:22:16,063
...betrayed...

1141
01:22:16,983 --> 01:22:21,382
...in the final hour because we chose to
send a representative who did not put our...

1142
01:22:21,863 --> 01:22:24,542
...most cherished beliefs first.

1143
01:22:27,703 --> 01:22:28,822
Thank you.

1144
01:23:00,699 --> 01:23:01,938
Why did you do it?

1145
01:23:06,339 --> 01:23:10,338
Our job was to select someone
to speak for everybody.

1146
01:23:13,499 --> 01:23:16,818
I just couldn't in good conscience
vote for a person...

1147
01:23:16,979 --> 01:23:18,898
...who doesn't believe in God.

1148
01:23:20,858 --> 01:23:22,177
Someone who...

1149
01:23:22,338 --> 01:23:25,617
...honestly thinks
the other 95 percent of us...

1150
01:23:25,818 --> 01:23:28,656
...suffer from some form
of mass delusion.

1151
01:23:31,697 --> 01:23:33,696
I told the truth up there.

1152
01:23:34,937 --> 01:23:38,296
And Drumlin told you exactly
what you wanted to hear.

1153
01:24:12,013 --> 01:24:14,492
With full humility and utmost gratitude...

1154
01:24:14,653 --> 01:24:16,773
...I accept this great honor...

1155
01:24:16,973 --> 01:24:20,852
...and I promise I will do my best
to represent my nation...

1156
01:24:21,013 --> 01:24:25,932
...my planet and my God
on this historic journey.

1157
01:24:26,093 --> 01:24:28,331
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

1158
01:25:09,169 --> 01:25:12,009
There's
a carnival atmosphere at Cape Canaveral...

1159
01:25:12,170 --> 01:25:14,128
...as the International
Machine Consortium...

1160
01:25:14,289 --> 01:25:17,608
...hosts as much a media event
as a systems test.

1161
01:25:18,089 --> 01:25:21,608
David Drumlin is supervising
the on-site portion of the test.

1162
01:25:21,809 --> 01:25:23,528
We spoke with him earlier today.

1163
01:25:23,689 --> 01:25:26,087
We'll be able to monjtor
the stresses and effects...

1164
01:25:26,249 --> 01:25:28,488
...using the robot passenger...

1165
01:25:28,968 --> 01:25:31,167
...who we lovingly call Elmer.

1166
01:25:31,327 --> 01:25:34,326
We are coming up
on T-minus two hours and counting.

1167
01:25:34,487 --> 01:25:36,446
All Machine systems are go.

1168
01:25:36,606 --> 01:25:39,365
Dr. Arroway, the press would like to
ask you a few questions...

1169
01:25:39,527 --> 01:25:42,085
...as soon as they're done
with Dr. Drumlin.

1170
01:25:43,326 --> 01:25:45,486
Now, at the moment
where we release the pod...

1171
01:25:45,646 --> 01:25:49,085
...there will be a substantial
amount of energy generated at the core.

1172
01:25:49,566 --> 01:25:51,845
We'll be able to monitor
the stresses and effects...

1173
01:25:52,006 --> 01:25:56,005
...using our robot passenger,
who we lovingly call Elmer.

1174
01:25:57,445 --> 01:25:59,004
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

1175
01:25:59,165 --> 01:26:01,004
The test area is clear and go.

1176
01:26:01,165 --> 01:26:03,844
Sir, they're ready for you out at the site.

1177
01:26:04,005 --> 01:26:05,564
Yeah, just a minute.

1178
01:26:06,565 --> 01:26:09,724
The test director has issued a go
to enter the final countdown phase.

1179
01:26:09,885 --> 01:26:11,163
Ellie.

1180
01:26:11,324 --> 01:26:13,604
- Congratulations, David.
- Glad you could come.

1181
01:26:14,884 --> 01:26:17,243
Didrt, uh, expect to see you here.

1182
01:26:17,924 --> 01:26:22,563
Well, I'm still, you know,
Crew Ops at the Control Center.

1183
01:26:23,204 --> 01:26:27,043
And I suppose the fact that I discovered
the message means that I have PR value.

1184
01:26:27,203 --> 01:26:28,803
Of course.

1185
01:26:30,243 --> 01:26:33,282
Ellie, I know you must think
this is all very unfair.

1186
01:26:33,923 --> 01:26:36,121
And maybe that's an understatement.

1187
01:26:37,163 --> 01:26:39,441
What you don't know is, I agree.

1188
01:26:40,002 --> 01:26:43,161
I wish the world was a place
where fair was the bottom line.

1189
01:26:43,322 --> 01:26:46,401
Where the kind of idealism you showed
at the hearing was rewarded...

1190
01:26:46,562 --> 01:26:48,761
...not taken advantage of.

1191
01:26:50,402 --> 01:26:53,399
Unfortunately,
we don't live in that world.

1192
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,800
Funny...

1193
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:01,119
...I always believed that the world
is what we make of it.

1194
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:05,759
Excuse me, Dr. Drumlin, sir?

1195
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:08,799
Good luck on the test.

1196
01:27:09,039 --> 01:27:11,278
- The pad leader has issued the order...
- Thank you.

1197
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:14,479
...to clear the pad of all nonessential...
- Right this way, sir.

1198
01:27:18,799 --> 01:27:22,518
Test director, everything looks good
up here. We're ready to go.

1199
01:27:22,679 --> 01:27:25,558
All right, people, I want
things double and triple checked here.

1200
01:27:25,719 --> 01:27:29,158
We only get one shot at this.
Let's get it right.

1201
01:27:29,318 --> 01:27:32,277
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are ready for startup.

1202
01:27:32,478 --> 01:27:35,677
All controllers, I need a go-no-go
for test initiation.

1203
01:27:35,838 --> 01:27:36,797
- Mechanical?
- Go.

1204
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:37,956
- Electrical?
- Go.

1205
01:27:38,117 --> 01:27:39,157
- Dynamics?
- Go.

1206
01:27:39,318 --> 01:27:40,557
- Communications?
- Go.

1207
01:27:40,717 --> 01:27:41,716
- Pod systems?
- Go

1208
01:27:41,877 --> 01:27:43,356
- Safety?
- Go.

1209
01:27:43,517 --> 01:27:46,317
Crew Ops, verify all pre-test
procedures are complete.

1210
01:27:46,477 --> 01:27:47,836
Yes, verified. I'm go.

1211
01:27:47,997 --> 01:27:50,396
Pad leader, we are good.
Is everything okay with you?

1212
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:53,116
Roger. The pad is a go.

1213
01:27:53,277 --> 01:27:55,996
Test initiation, on my mark.

1214
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:57,755
Five...

1215
01:27:57,916 --> 01:27:59,115
...four...

1216
01:27:59,276 --> 01:28:00,515
...three...

1217
01:28:00,676 --> 01:28:01,835
...two...

1218
01:28:02,236 --> 01:28:03,675
...one.

1219
01:28:03,836 --> 01:28:05,195
Mark.

1220
01:28:05,356 --> 01:28:07,034
- Test start.
- Rings are unlocked.

1221
01:28:07,195 --> 01:28:08,875
Power levels indicate a good start.

1222
01:28:09,036 --> 01:28:11,794
We have begun the full-scale
test of Earth's first system...

1223
01:28:11,955 --> 01:28:15,353
...built by the sharing of knowledge
with a neighbor in our universe.

1224
01:28:15,515 --> 01:28:17,673
All power sources on core induction bus.

1225
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:19,393
IPV power transfer.

1226
01:28:19,554 --> 01:28:23,153
Ring motion detect.
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie.

1227
01:28:24,154 --> 01:28:27,072
- Gerry, how are we looking?
- Looks good. We're underway.

1228
01:28:27,233 --> 01:28:28,912
Looks like we have a normal startup.

1229
01:28:29,073 --> 01:28:31,512
Roger, David.
It's looking good here.

1230
01:28:36,913 --> 01:28:39,912
We are moments away from
the initiation of the drop sequence.

1231
01:28:40,073 --> 01:28:41,992
All systems are go.

1232
01:28:44,033 --> 01:28:46,551
- Mechanical, you still happy?
- Roger that.

1233
01:28:46,712 --> 01:28:50,031
I'll tell you, this is very exciting
from up here.

1234
01:28:52,112 --> 01:28:55,590
- We've got 4 percent.
- We're confirming 4 percent.

1235
01:28:56,792 --> 01:28:59,990
Frequency 9.85.

1236
01:29:00,151 --> 01:29:05,670
Harmonics in the green.
G-level 1.1.

1237
01:29:05,831 --> 01:29:09,029
- Five percent.
- Confirmed. We are at 5 percent.

1238
01:29:09,190 --> 01:29:10,869
David, how's it looking to you?

1239
01:29:11,031 --> 01:29:13,749
Okay. I'm gonna take a look
and show you what we got.

1240
01:29:13,910 --> 01:29:15,989
All test-subject instrumentation
looks good.

1241
01:29:16,150 --> 01:29:19,669
Confirmed, we have a good picture
from Dr. Drumlirs PRD.

1242
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:22,188
Hope you guys are seeing
what I'm seeing.

1243
01:29:22,550 --> 01:29:24,388
All systems are go.

1244
01:29:25,909 --> 01:29:27,428
This is really something.

1245
01:29:27,629 --> 01:29:29,228
For purposes of this test...

1246
01:29:29,389 --> 01:29:33,427
...Dr. Drumlin will be on top of
the gantry crane that's over the Machine.

1247
01:29:33,588 --> 01:29:35,667
We've got some video animation...

1248
01:29:35,828 --> 01:29:39,186
...to show you just how this machine,
it is thought, will work.

1249
01:29:39,347 --> 01:29:40,947
The passenger pod will be released.

1250
01:29:41,147 --> 01:29:45,306
It will come down through the center of
the rings and into the Machine's core.

1251
01:29:45,467 --> 01:29:49,386
The big question everyone here is asking is,
of course, what happens then?

1252
01:29:49,547 --> 01:29:54,185
Some believe that the rings function as
some sort of an accelerator or something...

1253
01:29:54,347 --> 01:29:56,866
...sending its energy
into this passenger pod...

1254
01:29:57,026 --> 01:29:59,625
...making it rocket away
at near the speed of light.

1255
01:29:59,826 --> 01:30:04,265
Other people believe it might open up
a doorway to some other dimension.

1256
01:30:04,425 --> 01:30:07,744
Who's right?
Well, that's what today's test is all about.

1257
01:30:08,346 --> 01:30:10,705
- Thirty-five percent.
- Subsystems, are you ready?

1258
01:30:10,865 --> 01:30:13,904
- Forty percent normal acceleration.
- Roger, confirm 40 percent.

1259
01:30:14,105 --> 01:30:16,944
All controllers stand by
to initiate drop sequence...

1260
01:30:17,105 --> 01:30:18,624
...on my mark.

1261
01:30:18,785 --> 01:30:21,023
All systems ready for drop sequence.

1262
01:30:21,184 --> 01:30:23,343
Forty-five percent.

1263
01:30:23,504 --> 01:30:25,583
We're reading 45 percent.

1264
01:30:26,544 --> 01:30:28,463
Can you verify closure?

1265
01:30:29,704 --> 01:30:31,183
Forty-six.

1266
01:30:31,344 --> 01:30:35,822
All controllers stand by
to initiate IPV drop sequence. On my mark.

1267
01:30:36,464 --> 01:30:38,143
Forty-eight percent.

1268
01:30:38,743 --> 01:30:41,062
Test djrector,
I'm feeling a very strange vibration.

1269
01:30:41,223 --> 01:30:42,383
Are you feeling it down there?

1270
01:30:42,543 --> 01:30:44,422
Gerry, can you confirm any vibration?

1271
01:30:44,943 --> 01:30:46,702
Negative, everything looks good here.

1272
01:30:46,863 --> 01:30:48,782
- Crew Ops?
- Nothing wrong with Elmer.

1273
01:30:48,943 --> 01:30:50,702
We're not seeing anything abnormal.

1274
01:30:50,863 --> 01:30:53,540
No good. Hold the sequence.
I'm gonna take a direct reading.

1275
01:30:54,022 --> 01:30:57,260
- What the hell is he talking about?
- Can anyone say grandstanding?

1276
01:30:57,421 --> 01:30:59,340
He sure knows he's on TV!

1277
01:30:59,501 --> 01:31:02,500
Back home that's what we call
an overcooked ham.

1278
01:31:02,661 --> 01:31:05,060
I'm reading 10 kilohertz!

1279
01:31:05,221 --> 01:31:07,900
What's your reading on the first
and second order G-levels?

1280
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:09,899
G-levels are right on.

1281
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:13,739
We confirm Drumlirs readings
and they're all normal. We're go.

1282
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:15,339
Copy that, Dynamics.

1283
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:18,139
I think we're okay,
but we'll let him finish.

1284
01:31:19,299 --> 01:31:21,259
- Mechanical, you still okay?
- Roger, chief.

1285
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:22,699
We're right on the money.

1286
01:31:22,859 --> 01:31:25,058
We've got a security problem here.

1287
01:31:25,219 --> 01:31:26,738
Ellie, are you sure?

1288
01:31:26,899 --> 01:31:29,098
Yeah. This guy, he shouldn't be there.
I know him.

1289
01:31:29,259 --> 01:31:32,098
Gerry, execute the
rapid shutdown sequence.

1290
01:31:32,259 --> 01:31:35,418
Security, move emergency
response team into position one.

1291
01:31:35,579 --> 01:31:38,058
- Get me Drumlin on a secure loop, please.
- You got him.

1292
01:31:38,218 --> 01:31:41,577
- David, can you hear me?
- Yes, I hear.

1293
01:31:41,738 --> 01:31:43,937
All right, we've got
a security breach here.

1294
01:31:44,298 --> 01:31:46,217
Right behind you.
The tall guy.

1295
01:31:46,698 --> 01:31:49,817
The technician. See him?

1296
01:31:51,778 --> 01:31:54,056
He's not supposed to be there.

1297
01:31:58,537 --> 01:32:01,096
David, he's got something in his hand!

1298
01:32:01,256 --> 01:32:03,696
Him! Take him!
Security breach!

1299
01:32:04,337 --> 01:32:05,416
He's got a bomb!

1300
01:32:05,577 --> 01:32:08,096
I want that emergency-response
team up on the gantry now.

1301
01:32:08,256 --> 01:32:09,856
Security, stage one alert.

1302
01:32:10,017 --> 01:32:14,334
By God, move all the fire and
rescue personnel into position one.

1303
01:32:49,412 --> 01:32:51,451
All right, all right, back to your stations.

1304
01:32:51,612 --> 01:32:54,611
I need you to be professional, people.
Settle down.

1305
01:32:54,812 --> 01:32:57,571
Pad leader, pad leader, do you copy?

1306
01:33:14,291 --> 01:33:16,850
The scene earlier today,
when David Drumlin...

1307
01:33:17,051 --> 01:33:18,690
...advisor to two presidents...

1308
01:33:18,851 --> 01:33:22,690
...and winner of the National Academy
of Sciences lifetime award...

1309
01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:26,489
...was laid to rest
at Arlington National Cemetery.

1310
01:33:30,050 --> 01:33:31,889
In a related story, last night's raid...

1311
01:33:32,049 --> 01:33:33,528
Can I help you?

1312
01:33:33,688 --> 01:33:37,567
- Oh, you're... I've got some mail for you.
...resulted in the discovery of this video.

1313
01:33:37,728 --> 01:33:42,247
The suicide note of the leader of the
terrorist group now believed responsible...

1314
01:33:42,408 --> 01:33:44,847
...for the explosion in Florida this week.

1315
01:33:45,008 --> 01:33:49,807
What we do,
we do for the goodness of all mankind.

1316
01:33:50,447 --> 01:33:53,247
This won't be understood, not now...

1317
01:33:53,408 --> 01:33:55,286
...but the apocalypse to come...

1318
01:33:56,407 --> 01:33:58,486
...will vindicate our faith.

1319
01:34:21,806 --> 01:34:23,565
Welcome home.

1320
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:28,919
Oh, Comrade Arroway...

1321
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:32,239
...he has been expecting your call.
One moment, please.

1322
01:35:41,599 --> 01:35:42,758
Mr. Hadden?

1323
01:35:43,359 --> 01:35:44,637
Doctor.

1324
01:35:45,719 --> 01:35:47,438
How kind of you to call.

1325
01:35:48,118 --> 01:35:50,437
Mr. Hadden, where are you?

1326
01:35:52,078 --> 01:35:56,557
The Russian government was kind enough
to give me accommodations on Mir.

1327
01:35:57,358 --> 01:35:59,157
You're living on a space station?

1328
01:36:00,598 --> 01:36:02,837
It's quite simple, really.

1329
01:36:03,837 --> 01:36:07,276
The low-oxygen,
zero-gravity environment...

1330
01:36:07,437 --> 01:36:11,956
...is the only thing keeping
the cancer from eating me alive.

1331
01:36:13,435 --> 01:36:16,035
Actually, I quite like it up here.

1332
01:36:16,475 --> 01:36:20,115
My little room has one hell of a view.

1333
01:36:26,995 --> 01:36:29,394
I wanna show you something.

1334
01:36:33,395 --> 01:36:35,754
Hokkaido Island.

1335
01:36:36,634 --> 01:36:38,914
The systems integration site.

1336
01:36:39,874 --> 01:36:42,033
Look closer.

1337
01:36:49,354 --> 01:36:52,832
First rule in government spending:

1338
01:36:52,993 --> 01:36:56,752
Why build one when you can have
two at twice the price?

1339
01:36:56,913 --> 01:37:00,552
Only, this one can be kept secret.

1340
01:37:00,713 --> 01:37:02,671
Controlled by Americans...

1341
01:37:02,832 --> 01:37:06,311
...built by the Japanese subcontractors...

1342
01:37:06,992 --> 01:37:10,431
...who also happen to be...

1343
01:37:10,592 --> 01:37:12,591
...recently acquired...

1344
01:37:12,752 --> 01:37:15,751
...wholly-owned subsidiaries...

1345
01:37:15,912 --> 01:37:18,190
...of Hadden Industries.
- Of Hadden Industries.

1346
01:37:21,231 --> 01:37:24,270
They still want
an American to go, doctor.

1347
01:37:27,751 --> 01:37:29,990
Wanna take a ride?

1348
01:38:10,387 --> 01:38:14,506
And augmenting our restraint and
communications console subsystem...

1349
01:38:14,666 --> 01:38:16,585
...we have your personal recording unit.

1350
01:38:16,746 --> 01:38:20,705
Normal, infrared and ultraviolet lenses.

1351
01:38:20,866 --> 01:38:24,745
Digital microchip good for
thousands of hours of recording.

1352
01:38:25,905 --> 01:38:27,905
Okay, look, I understand...

1353
01:38:28,066 --> 01:38:31,345
...the reason for recording
and documenting the mission.

1354
01:38:31,506 --> 01:38:34,225
But I just... I wanna go on record
one more time.

1355
01:38:34,386 --> 01:38:37,744
The transmitted specs
never said anything about any chair...

1356
01:38:37,985 --> 01:38:42,304
...or a restraining harness or survival gear.

1357
01:38:42,465 --> 01:38:44,224
Why can't we just trust the original...?

1358
01:38:44,385 --> 01:38:48,344
Doctor, both the IMC Board
and the SI team reviewed the matter...

1359
01:38:48,544 --> 01:38:52,143
...and concluded that
the design impact is negligible.

1360
01:38:52,304 --> 01:38:53,942
Bottom line is...

1361
01:38:54,103 --> 01:38:56,342
...we're not putting anybody
aboard this machine...

1362
01:38:56,543 --> 01:38:59,422
...unless there is
some sort of minimal protection.

1363
01:38:59,583 --> 01:39:01,382
End of story.

1364
01:39:03,703 --> 01:39:06,821
- Okay.
- Ellie...

1365
01:39:07,662 --> 01:39:11,581
...we've been giving these to the astronauts
since the beginning of the space program.

1366
01:39:12,862 --> 01:39:15,061
It's never been made public, of course.

1367
01:39:15,262 --> 01:39:17,261
It's fast and it's painless.

1368
01:39:19,902 --> 01:39:22,661
I'm gonna travel 26 light years
to commit suicide?

1369
01:39:22,821 --> 01:39:24,940
Something may go wrong.

1370
01:39:25,101 --> 01:39:27,740
There may be
an unforeseen mechanical failure.

1371
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:31,420
You could be marooned, unable to return.

1372
01:39:32,541 --> 01:39:35,540
There are a thousand reasons
we can think of for you to have this...

1373
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:38,779
...but mostly it's for the reasons
we can't think of.

1374
01:40:03,978 --> 01:40:05,057
Come in.

1375
01:40:06,538 --> 01:40:10,377
- Dr. Arroway, time to get ready.
- Thank you.

1376
01:40:20,616 --> 01:40:22,255
I know you don't have much time.

1377
01:40:22,416 --> 01:40:25,375
As soon as I found out about the Machine,
I called the president.

1378
01:40:25,576 --> 01:40:27,575
I came with Kitz.

1379
01:40:27,736 --> 01:40:29,935
I had to see you one more time.

1380
01:40:30,096 --> 01:40:31,775
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1381
01:40:31,935 --> 01:40:33,734
No, I'm glad you came.

1382
01:40:33,895 --> 01:40:36,654
There's something I gotta say to you.

1383
01:40:37,495 --> 01:40:41,574
The reason I didn't vote for you to go was
a good reason, but it wasrt the real one.

1384
01:40:42,615 --> 01:40:44,534
I didn't vote for you to go...

1385
01:40:46,015 --> 01:40:48,094
...because I don't wanna lose you.

1386
01:40:49,094 --> 01:40:51,813
You find your way home, all right?

1387
01:41:07,533 --> 01:41:08,892
Twenty-three hours ago...

1388
01:41:09,053 --> 01:41:12,931
...the world was stunned by the
announcement of a second Machine...

1389
01:41:13,092 --> 01:41:16,091
...and its passenger,
Eleanor Ann Arroway.

1390
01:41:16,292 --> 01:41:19,731
Now the question
that's on everyone's mind:

1391
01:41:19,892 --> 01:41:21,811
Will history repeat itself?

1392
01:41:21,972 --> 01:41:24,171
With a piece of engineering
this complex...

1393
01:41:24,332 --> 01:41:28,251
...with so many unknowns,
could the unthinkable occur?

1394
01:41:28,412 --> 01:41:31,730
The security in Hokkaido
has been incredibly tight.

1395
01:41:31,891 --> 01:41:35,089
No reporters whatsoever
have been allowed near the site.

1396
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:53,159
Thanks.

1397
01:44:09,039 --> 01:44:11,917
Magnetic restraint is secure.
All life support functions normal.

1398
01:44:12,119 --> 01:44:15,157
Roger that. Ellie, this is Control.
Do you copy?

1399
01:44:15,317 --> 01:44:17,556
Ellie to Control, reading you five-by-five.

1400
01:44:17,717 --> 01:44:21,636
- Comm 1, Give me Ellie's PRD.
- Video unit recording and transmitting.

1401
01:44:22,557 --> 01:44:24,996
- Are you reading me?
- That's affirmative.

1402
01:44:25,157 --> 01:44:27,356
Video looks good.

1403
01:44:27,517 --> 01:44:29,956
- Copy that, Control.
- Okay.

1404
01:44:30,117 --> 01:44:32,875
Ellie, we're gonna proceed
to button you up.

1405
01:44:33,036 --> 01:44:35,595
Roger, Control. I'm ready.

1406
01:44:38,876 --> 01:44:41,155
- Dynamics...
- I can confirm the walkway retraction.

1407
01:44:41,316 --> 01:44:42,275
- Systems?
- Go.

1408
01:44:42,436 --> 01:44:43,754
- Communications?
- Go.

1409
01:44:43,916 --> 01:44:45,514
- Life support?
- Go.

1410
01:44:45,675 --> 01:44:47,874
Ellie, we are go for closure.

1411
01:44:49,275 --> 01:44:51,074
I'm go here.

1412
01:44:51,915 --> 01:44:55,274
Mechanical, initiate
IPV closure sequence.

1413
01:44:56,835 --> 01:44:58,953
Hold on, let me get you a chair.

1414
01:44:59,634 --> 01:45:00,633
I'm go.

1415
01:45:00,794 --> 01:45:04,513
- It's nice to smell you again, Mr. Kitz.
- You too.

1416
01:45:04,674 --> 01:45:06,433
Wouldrt peg him as a Polo man.

1417
01:45:15,593 --> 01:45:16,873
I got a visual on the door.

1418
01:45:17,033 --> 01:45:18,912
IPV escape system is armed.

1419
01:45:19,074 --> 01:45:20,992
Door is looking good.

1420
01:45:25,993 --> 01:45:27,591
Door alignment looks good.

1421
01:45:55,029 --> 01:45:57,029
Ellie, we are showing green
across the board.

1422
01:45:57,190 --> 01:46:00,388
Copy that, Control. IPV is secure.

1423
01:46:07,228 --> 01:46:09,147
We are at 30 percent.

1424
01:46:09,308 --> 01:46:10,547
Copy that, 30 percent.

1425
01:46:15,228 --> 01:46:17,787
- How you doing in there, EI?
- Kent?

1426
01:46:18,508 --> 01:46:21,187
- Is that you?
- That's a big affirmative.

1427
01:46:22,068 --> 01:46:23,587
Who let you in there, huh?

1428
01:46:23,748 --> 01:46:25,787
A higher power intervened.

1429
01:46:27,748 --> 01:46:29,026
Well, I'm glad you came.

1430
01:46:33,587 --> 01:46:34,706
Thirty-five percent.

1431
01:46:35,427 --> 01:46:36,866
Copy that, 35 percent.

1432
01:46:37,027 --> 01:46:38,306
- Mechanical?
- We're good.

1433
01:46:38,467 --> 01:46:39,745
Forty percent.

1434
01:46:43,227 --> 01:46:45,026
I'm picking up a moderate vibration here.

1435
01:46:46,147 --> 01:46:49,625
- Dynamics, can you confirm vibration?
- Everything looks good here.

1436
01:46:49,826 --> 01:46:52,945
She's feeling the same thing
they felt at the Cape at this point.

1437
01:46:53,106 --> 01:46:54,625
Ellie, the vibration is normal.

1438
01:46:54,786 --> 01:46:57,183
We are at 50 percent.
All systems nominal.

1439
01:46:57,345 --> 01:46:59,263
Copy that, 50 percent.

1440
01:47:04,224 --> 01:47:06,143
Vibration is getting a little stronger now.

1441
01:47:06,304 --> 01:47:09,023
We're picking up
some low-frequency noise.

1442
01:47:09,384 --> 01:47:12,343
- Mechanical, can you confirm?
- It looks fine to me.

1443
01:47:12,503 --> 01:47:15,743
- Roger. Gerry, what do you think?
- I'm still go.

1444
01:47:15,904 --> 01:47:17,462
People, we are still go.

1445
01:47:19,143 --> 01:47:21,502
What...? Something's happening.

1446
01:47:22,703 --> 01:47:25,261
I'm... There's...

1447
01:47:25,422 --> 01:47:28,141
There's a light. Do you see that?
I'm seeing some...

1448
01:47:28,862 --> 01:47:31,221
Something, some...

1449
01:47:31,382 --> 01:47:33,821
I can't tell whether it's daylight or not.

1450
01:47:33,982 --> 01:47:36,781
There it is again.
It's coming from the bottom.

1451
01:47:37,782 --> 01:47:39,260
Here, let me show you.
See that?

1452
01:47:39,422 --> 01:47:41,261
Negative.
Ellie, you're breaking up.

1453
01:47:41,422 --> 01:47:44,141
- Comm 1, can we boost her signal?
- Already at maximum.

1454
01:47:44,302 --> 01:47:45,781
Sixty-five percent.

1455
01:47:45,942 --> 01:47:47,580
The material is changing.

1456
01:47:47,741 --> 01:47:51,100
It's bordering on translucence.
But the system is intact.

1457
01:47:54,261 --> 01:47:58,459
It's gotta be some kind
of electromagnetic field.

1458
01:47:58,620 --> 01:48:01,499
- Are you reading this?
- Negative, we're seeing only interference.

1459
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:06,779
It's becoming completely translucent.
I can't describe it. I can't even explain it.

1460
01:48:09,139 --> 01:48:10,138
Seventy percent.

1461
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:12,539
People, we have intermittent comm,
but we are go.

1462
01:48:12,699 --> 01:48:16,977
- Initiate secondary drive systems.
- Initiating auxiliary booster sequence.

1463
01:48:17,178 --> 01:48:18,937
We're go for ignition.

1464
01:48:25,698 --> 01:48:28,056
We have auxiliary booster ignition.

1465
01:48:33,497 --> 01:48:34,936
Life support, how is she doing?

1466
01:48:35,097 --> 01:48:38,215
We still have data. Heart and respiration
are high but within limits.

1467
01:48:38,376 --> 01:48:39,416
Ellie, do you copy?

1468
01:48:39,616 --> 01:48:42,495
If you could hear, I am okay to go.

1469
01:48:46,137 --> 01:48:47,855
If you could hear me...

1470
01:48:50,815 --> 01:48:52,135
Eighty percent.

1471
01:48:52,296 --> 01:48:55,015
All vibration and G-levels are in the green.

1472
01:49:00,215 --> 01:49:02,454
Control, if you're reading me...

1473
01:49:02,615 --> 01:49:04,854
...I am okay to go. Okay to go.

1474
01:49:05,015 --> 01:49:08,653
- Eighty-five percent.
- All bearing tips are on the profile.

1475
01:49:09,494 --> 01:49:12,454
Ninety percent. We're detecting
some structural instability.

1476
01:49:12,615 --> 01:49:16,373
- Confirmed. Is she holding?
- We're within limits, barely.

1477
01:49:17,814 --> 01:49:23,492
I'm okay to go.

1478
01:49:29,173 --> 01:49:30,573
My God!

1479
01:49:41,171 --> 01:49:43,571
Okay to go. I'm okay.

1480
01:49:43,971 --> 01:49:45,410
Hundred percent target velocity.

1481
01:49:45,571 --> 01:49:46,730
Steve?

1482
01:49:46,891 --> 01:49:51,090
Tremendous EMI levels around the Machine.
All field measurements are off-scale.

1483
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:53,610
Steve, we're approaching our abort limits.

1484
01:49:55,891 --> 01:49:56,929
Okay to go.

1485
01:50:01,930 --> 01:50:03,089
I hear her!

1486
01:50:03,250 --> 01:50:05,968
I hear her.
Barely, but she's there.

1487
01:50:06,129 --> 01:50:09,008
- Okay to go.
- She says she's okay to go.

1488
01:50:11,889 --> 01:50:13,928
Steve, we're real close.

1489
01:50:14,089 --> 01:50:16,848
- Electrical, reading in the core?
- Internal environment normal.

1490
01:50:17,009 --> 01:50:19,888
Inside the core, the weather's beautiful.

1491
01:50:23,808 --> 01:50:25,008
I'm okay to go.

1492
01:50:25,488 --> 01:50:28,807
Okay to go.
I'm okay to go.

1493
01:50:29,368 --> 01:50:31,607
Initiate drop sequence.

1494
01:50:34,087 --> 01:50:35,726
On my mark.

1495
01:50:36,407 --> 01:50:38,847
Ten, nine...

1496
01:50:39,887 --> 01:50:41,806
...eight...

1497
01:50:42,128 --> 01:50:45,006
...seven, six...

1498
01:50:45,167 --> 01:50:47,686
...five, four...

1499
01:50:47,847 --> 01:50:50,405
...three, two...

1500
01:50:50,567 --> 01:50:51,886
I'm okay to go.

1501
01:50:55,686 --> 01:50:57,404
Oh, God!

1502
01:51:06,285 --> 01:51:07,884
Ellie to Control.

1503
01:51:08,524 --> 01:51:10,779
Ellie to Control, do you read me?

1504
01:51:15,287 --> 01:51:17,588
Ellie to Control, do you read me?

1505
01:51:23,684 --> 01:51:26,963
I'm gonna try to keep recording.

1506
01:51:27,684 --> 01:51:32,042
I'm going through
some kind of a tunnel.

1507
01:51:46,122 --> 01:51:47,601
There's a light source ahead.

1508
01:51:48,082 --> 01:51:51,160
Brilliant and blue-white.

1509
01:51:52,322 --> 01:51:53,881
Residual radiation?

1510
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:06,399
It's a star.

1511
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:10,239
I must have gone through a wormhole.

1512
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:16,439
It's Vega.

1513
01:52:27,199 --> 01:52:28,677
I'm in another wormhole now.

1514
01:52:32,198 --> 01:52:33,277
I had no idea.

1515
01:52:33,438 --> 01:52:35,157
A series of them.

1516
01:52:38,038 --> 01:52:39,237
They're alive.

1517
01:52:39,398 --> 01:52:43,196
It's like some kind of a transit system.

1518
01:52:44,157 --> 01:52:45,476
It's a subway.

1519
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:52,315
Okay.

1520
01:52:52,476 --> 01:52:54,675
Okay, I've gotta keep talking.

1521
01:52:57,116 --> 01:53:00,835
It's a triple...
No, quadruple system.

1522
01:53:01,236 --> 01:53:02,435
It's beautiful.

1523
01:53:05,635 --> 01:53:06,994
They're alive.

1524
01:53:14,835 --> 01:53:16,434
Another wormhole!

1525
01:53:16,755 --> 01:53:18,513
This one is much more violent!

1526
01:54:48,108 --> 01:54:49,706
Some...

1527
01:54:50,147 --> 01:54:52,387
...celestial event...

1528
01:54:53,587 --> 01:54:55,226
No...

1529
01:54:55,387 --> 01:54:58,905
No words. No words...

1530
01:55:00,506 --> 01:55:02,625
...to describe it.

1531
01:55:03,985 --> 01:55:05,784
Poetry.

1532
01:55:06,906 --> 01:55:10,264
They should have sent a poet.

1533
01:55:10,545 --> 01:55:13,024
It's so beautiful.

1534
01:55:13,185 --> 01:55:14,584
Beautiful.

1535
01:55:16,345 --> 01:55:21,423
So beautiful.

1536
01:55:22,264 --> 01:55:25,035
I had no idea.

1537
01:55:26,091 --> 01:55:28,104
I had no idea.

1538
01:55:29,784 --> 01:55:32,983
I had no...

1539
01:55:34,224 --> 01:55:37,383
I had no idea.

1540
01:55:38,663 --> 01:55:41,066
I had no idea.

1541
01:55:42,026 --> 01:55:44,231
I had no idea.

1542
01:57:57,692 --> 01:57:59,011
Hi, Sparks.

1543
01:58:00,812 --> 01:58:02,250
Dad?

1544
01:58:09,411 --> 01:58:11,210
I missed you.

1545
01:58:16,611 --> 01:58:17,729
Arert you...?

1546
01:58:17,931 --> 01:58:21,009
I'm sorry I couldn't
be there for you, sweetheart.

1547
01:58:30,410 --> 01:58:32,008
You're not real.

1548
01:58:33,450 --> 01:58:34,888
None of this is real.

1549
01:58:35,049 --> 01:58:37,128
That's my scientist.

1550
01:58:38,169 --> 01:58:42,368
When I was unconscious, you downloaded
my thoughts, my memory even.

1551
01:58:43,169 --> 01:58:45,128
Pensacola.

1552
01:58:47,528 --> 01:58:50,367
We thought this might
make things easier for you.

1553
01:59:03,327 --> 01:59:06,806
- Why did you contact us?
- You contacted us.

1554
01:59:06,966 --> 01:59:08,566
We were just listening.

1555
01:59:09,407 --> 01:59:10,646
And there are others?

1556
01:59:10,806 --> 01:59:12,365
Many others.

1557
01:59:17,005 --> 01:59:18,445
They all...

1558
01:59:18,605 --> 01:59:21,605
...travel here through that
transit system that you built?

1559
01:59:22,125 --> 01:59:23,564
We didn't build it.

1560
01:59:24,685 --> 01:59:26,124
We don't know who did.

1561
01:59:28,125 --> 01:59:30,963
No, they were gone
long before we ever got here.

1562
01:59:31,565 --> 01:59:33,323
Maybe someday they'll come back.

1563
01:59:34,124 --> 01:59:36,723
All the other civilizations that you find,
they come here?

1564
01:59:36,924 --> 01:59:38,083
Not all.

1565
01:59:39,804 --> 01:59:42,843
- Is this some test?
- No, no tests.

1566
01:59:45,643 --> 01:59:47,162
You have your mother's hands.

1567
01:59:56,923 --> 01:59:59,002
You're an interesting species...

1568
01:59:59,642 --> 02:00:01,522
...an interesting mix.

1569
02:00:02,402 --> 02:00:05,082
You're capable of
such beautiful dreams...

1570
02:00:06,082 --> 02:00:08,441
...and such horrible nightmares.

1571
02:00:09,562 --> 02:00:11,321
You feel so lost...

1572
02:00:11,882 --> 02:00:14,720
...so cut off, so alone.

1573
02:00:16,122 --> 02:00:17,801
Only you're not.

1574
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:21,279
See...

1575
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:23,279
In all our searching...

1576
02:00:23,480 --> 02:00:26,839
...the only thing we've found
that makes the emptiness bearable...

1577
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,558
...is each other.

1578
02:00:32,159 --> 02:00:33,999
What happens now?

1579
02:00:34,999 --> 02:00:36,438
Now?

1580
02:00:37,319 --> 02:00:39,038
You go home.

1581
02:00:39,199 --> 02:00:40,558
Home?

1582
02:00:40,719 --> 02:00:43,678
But I have so many questions.

1583
02:00:43,839 --> 02:00:45,878
Do we get to come back?

1584
02:00:46,719 --> 02:00:48,877
This was just a first step.

1585
02:00:49,038 --> 02:00:50,718
In time, you'll take another.

1586
02:00:52,238 --> 02:00:54,517
But other people need to see
what I've seen...

1587
02:00:54,678 --> 02:00:57,597
This is the way it's been done
for billions of years.

1588
02:00:59,518 --> 02:01:02,036
- But I...
- Small moves, Ellie.

1589
02:01:03,437 --> 02:01:05,277
Small moves.

1590
02:01:46,593 --> 02:01:48,313
We've got video on Ellie.
Five-by-five.

1591
02:01:48,513 --> 02:01:50,312
She's through! She is in the net.

1592
02:01:50,473 --> 02:01:53,352
She's alive. Get the White House.
Get the president on the phone.

1593
02:01:53,513 --> 02:01:55,792
What's going on, Steve? How is she?
How is she?

1594
02:01:55,953 --> 02:01:57,592
Ellie, this is Control. Do you copy?

1595
02:01:57,753 --> 02:01:59,712
- What's going on?
- I don't know. Hang on.

1596
02:01:59,872 --> 02:02:01,431
- She is alive.
- Put her on the PA.

1597
02:02:01,593 --> 02:02:03,112
Ellie, just hold on tight.

1598
02:02:03,712 --> 02:02:06,871
We're still trying to determine
the nature of the malfunction...

1599
02:02:07,032 --> 02:02:09,431
...but the important thing is you're okay.

1600
02:02:09,592 --> 02:02:10,711
What?

1601
02:02:10,872 --> 02:02:14,511
It's all right, Ellie.
The important thing is that you're safe.

1602
02:02:15,432 --> 02:02:17,630
What malfunction?

1603
02:02:18,912 --> 02:02:20,310
What...?

1604
02:02:21,431 --> 02:02:22,990
What happened?

1605
02:02:24,271 --> 02:02:25,870
What day is this?

1606
02:02:26,511 --> 02:02:29,389
I'm sorry, Ellie,
did you say what day?

1607
02:02:30,431 --> 02:02:32,590
How long was I gone?

1608
02:02:34,271 --> 02:02:38,869
Ellie, the IPV dropped
straight through the Machine.

1609
02:02:39,030 --> 02:02:40,629
You didn't go anywhere.

1610
02:02:41,470 --> 02:02:44,669
But I did. I did go.

1611
02:02:44,830 --> 02:02:47,108
That's what I've been trying
to tell everyone.

1612
02:02:51,389 --> 02:02:54,348
But the headset
didn't record a single image?

1613
02:02:54,509 --> 02:02:57,028
Just this. Static.

1614
02:02:57,229 --> 02:02:58,228
Thank you.

1615
02:02:58,389 --> 02:03:01,667
Now, doctor, let me show you
what we saw.

1616
02:03:10,747 --> 02:03:14,426
Forty-three separate remote cameras
show exactly the same event.

1617
02:03:14,587 --> 02:03:16,066
The IPV dropped straight through.

1618
02:03:16,227 --> 02:03:19,666
Everyone who watched
saw exactly the same thing.

1619
02:03:19,826 --> 02:03:21,586
Nothing happened.

1620
02:03:22,866 --> 02:03:25,065
How do you explain this, doctor?

1621
02:03:26,986 --> 02:03:28,064
I can't.

1622
02:03:28,266 --> 02:03:29,665
I would encourage you...

1623
02:03:31,385 --> 02:03:35,384
...not to inflame this situation
beyond the facts.

1624
02:03:35,545 --> 02:03:38,824
Let us deal with this on the facts.

1625
02:03:38,985 --> 02:03:41,744
We are monitoring
what has actually happened.

1626
02:03:41,904 --> 02:03:47,023
We are taking what we believe
is factually appropriate steps.

1627
02:03:47,184 --> 02:03:50,263
Amid a flurry of accusations
and counter-accusations...

1628
02:03:50,464 --> 02:03:52,943
...by the nations representing
the Machine Consortium...

1629
02:03:53,104 --> 02:03:55,902
...the president has ordered
a special inquiry.

1630
02:03:56,104 --> 02:03:58,782
However, the appointment
to the committee of Michael Kitz...

1631
02:03:58,984 --> 02:04:01,702
...who has recently resigned
as National Security Advisor...

1632
02:04:01,863 --> 02:04:04,103
...has raised a number of eyebrows
on Capitol Hill.

1633
02:04:04,263 --> 02:04:07,902
I have made no decision to run for
Congress, I have announced no candidacy.

1634
02:04:08,063 --> 02:04:10,542
The fact that I resigned
as National Security Advisor...

1635
02:04:10,702 --> 02:04:12,341
...has nothing to do with anything...

1636
02:04:12,502 --> 02:04:15,541
...other than I want to devote
all of my energy to this inquiry.

1637
02:04:16,263 --> 02:04:20,740
The people of the world have a right
to know what really happened.

1638
02:04:21,541 --> 02:04:23,940
And yet every scientific
instrument confirms...

1639
02:04:24,101 --> 02:04:28,100
...the IPV was out of contact
for only a fraction of a second.

1640
02:04:28,260 --> 02:04:30,219
Isn't that correct, doctor?

1641
02:04:31,860 --> 02:04:34,059
A fraction of a second Earth time, yes.

1642
02:04:34,900 --> 02:04:36,099
Earth time?

1643
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:39,739
Senator, I believe that the Machine
opened up a wormhole...

1644
02:04:39,900 --> 02:04:44,659
...a tunnel through the fabric of space-time,
also known as an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

1645
02:04:44,820 --> 02:04:48,778
Now, because of the effects of general
relativity, what I experienced as 18 hours...

1646
02:04:48,940 --> 02:04:51,098
...passed instantaneously on Earth.

1647
02:04:51,259 --> 02:04:55,417
Isn't it true that these wormholes you
speak of are merely theoretical predictions?

1648
02:04:55,579 --> 02:04:58,218
There is no evidence
they actually exist, is there?

1649
02:04:58,379 --> 02:05:00,018
There is no direct evidence, no.

1650
02:05:00,179 --> 02:05:01,857
Tell me something, doctor...

1651
02:05:02,018 --> 02:05:05,017
...why do you think these aliens
would go to all this trouble?

1652
02:05:05,178 --> 02:05:09,217
Bring you tens of thousands of light years
and then send you home without proof?

1653
02:05:09,858 --> 02:05:12,457
They said that's how it's been done
for billions of years.

1654
02:05:12,817 --> 02:05:16,256
That's very neat. You have no proof
because they didn't want you to have any.

1655
02:05:16,417 --> 02:05:20,976
A phenomenon known in psychiatric circles,
I believe, as a self-reinforcing delusion.

1656
02:05:21,537 --> 02:05:23,096
Is that what you think? Delusional?

1657
02:05:23,257 --> 02:05:27,215
Well, I do think you may have suffered
some kind of an episode. Yeah, I do.

1658
02:05:27,376 --> 02:05:30,135
Doctor, I'd like to propose
an alternate hypothesis...

1659
02:05:30,337 --> 02:05:33,855
...and I'd like you to bring
your scientific expertise to bear on it.

1660
02:05:34,016 --> 02:05:37,095
To fake a signal from Vega...

1661
02:05:37,736 --> 02:05:39,255
...what would you need?

1662
02:05:40,895 --> 02:05:44,533
You would need a satellite to transmit
the signal, but it would be impossible to...

1663
02:05:44,694 --> 02:05:48,454
You'd need a satellite and need launch
capabilities to put the satellite into orbit.

1664
02:05:48,614 --> 02:05:51,693
And the message itself.
To put something like this together...

1665
02:05:51,854 --> 02:05:54,053
...so complex,
drawing on many disciplines...

1666
02:05:54,214 --> 02:05:56,093
- Would be impossible.
- Impossible?

1667
02:05:57,334 --> 02:05:59,172
Impossible?

1668
02:05:59,333 --> 02:06:02,812
Is there anyone who might
have been up to the challenge?

1669
02:06:02,973 --> 02:06:05,333
Someone with extraordinary
technical expertise...

1670
02:06:05,493 --> 02:06:07,612
...enormous financial resources...

1671
02:06:07,773 --> 02:06:11,972
...someone perverse enough,
eccentric enough to come up with the idea?

1672
02:06:13,292 --> 02:06:14,291
Hadden?

1673
02:06:15,212 --> 02:06:17,571
S. R. Hadden.

1674
02:06:21,692 --> 02:06:24,611
You're implying that this was
all some kind of a hoax?

1675
02:06:24,772 --> 02:06:25,971
That he engineered this?

1676
02:06:26,132 --> 02:06:27,331
S. R. Hadden...

1677
02:06:27,492 --> 02:06:32,170
...a legendary power broker and manipulator
in perhaps his final bid for immortality.

1678
02:06:32,332 --> 02:06:34,890
Maybe he wanted to explore
and exploit new technologies...

1679
02:06:35,051 --> 02:06:37,170
...and get the governments
to pick up the tab.

1680
02:06:37,371 --> 02:06:40,010
Perhaps this was his
final altruistic gesture...

1681
02:06:40,251 --> 02:06:43,810
...to unite the world in some common goal.
Maybe all of the above.

1682
02:06:43,971 --> 02:06:48,689
S. R. Hadden, a brilliant
and complicated man.

1683
02:06:51,130 --> 02:06:55,209
Doctor, are you familiar
with the scientific precept...

1684
02:06:55,370 --> 02:06:57,409
...known as Occam's razor?

1685
02:07:03,368 --> 02:07:04,487
Yes.

1686
02:07:06,408 --> 02:07:08,407
It means that all things being equal...

1687
02:07:08,567 --> 02:07:10,967
...the simplest explanation
tends to be the right one.

1688
02:07:11,128 --> 02:07:12,607
Exactly.

1689
02:07:12,768 --> 02:07:15,127
Now, you tell me.
What is more likely here?

1690
02:07:15,287 --> 02:07:18,606
That a message from aliens
results in a magical machine...

1691
02:07:18,767 --> 02:07:21,366
...that whisks you away
to the center of the galaxy...

1692
02:07:21,567 --> 02:07:24,325
...to go windsurfing with your dad
and a split second later...

1693
02:07:24,486 --> 02:07:27,805
...returns you home
without a single shred of proof?

1694
02:07:27,967 --> 02:07:31,605
Or that your experience
is the result of being...

1695
02:07:31,766 --> 02:07:36,045
...the unwitting star in the farewell
performance of one S.R. Hadden?

1696
02:07:36,206 --> 02:07:39,844
A man with the means, motive and
opportunity to play you and the rest of us...

1697
02:07:40,086 --> 02:07:44,124
...as pawns in the biggest, most elaborate,
most expensive hoax of all time?

1698
02:07:45,365 --> 02:07:47,205
Dr. Arroway.

1699
02:07:49,006 --> 02:07:53,204
You come to us with no evidence,
no record...

1700
02:07:53,365 --> 02:07:55,084
...no artifacts.

1701
02:07:55,245 --> 02:07:59,244
Only a story that, to put it mildly,
strains credibility.

1702
02:08:00,324 --> 02:08:03,323
Over half a trillion dollars were spent.

1703
02:08:03,484 --> 02:08:06,363
Dozens of lives were lost.

1704
02:08:06,964 --> 02:08:11,483
Are you really gonna sit there
and tell us we should just take this all...

1705
02:08:12,203 --> 02:08:13,683
...on faith?

1706
02:08:17,524 --> 02:08:19,642
Please answer the question, doctor.

1707
02:08:23,402 --> 02:08:25,401
Is it possible that it didn't happen?

1708
02:08:25,562 --> 02:08:26,681
Yes.

1709
02:08:29,442 --> 02:08:32,440
As a scientist I must concede that.
I must volunteer that.

1710
02:08:36,600 --> 02:08:38,440
Wait a minute, let me get this straight.

1711
02:08:38,601 --> 02:08:42,320
You admit you have absolutely no
physical evidence to back up your story?

1712
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:43,639
Yes.

1713
02:08:43,800 --> 02:08:46,720
You admit that you very well may have
hallucinated this whole thing?

1714
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:49,559
- Yes.
- You admit that if you were in our position...

1715
02:08:49,720 --> 02:08:53,319
...you would respond with exactly the same
degree of incredulity and skepticism?

1716
02:08:53,479 --> 02:08:54,679
Yes.

1717
02:08:54,839 --> 02:08:57,679
Then why don't you simply withdraw
your testimony and concede...

1718
02:08:57,840 --> 02:09:02,798
...that this journey to the center of
the galaxy in fact never took place?

1719
02:09:05,679 --> 02:09:07,597
Because I can't.

1720
02:09:13,879 --> 02:09:17,397
I had an experience.

1721
02:09:18,998 --> 02:09:21,477
I can't prove it.
I can't even explain it.

1722
02:09:21,638 --> 02:09:24,596
But everything that I know as
a human being, everything I am...

1723
02:09:24,757 --> 02:09:26,796
...tells me it was real.

1724
02:09:28,757 --> 02:09:32,476
I was given something wonderful,
something that changed me forever.

1725
02:09:32,637 --> 02:09:34,116
A vision...

1726
02:09:34,277 --> 02:09:36,276
...of the universe...

1727
02:09:36,437 --> 02:09:38,995
...that tells us undeniably...

1728
02:09:39,156 --> 02:09:41,315
...how tiny and insignificant...

1729
02:09:41,475 --> 02:09:45,034
...and how rare and precious we all are.

1730
02:09:46,155 --> 02:09:48,474
A vision that tells us
that we belong to something...

1731
02:09:48,635 --> 02:09:54,073
...that is greater than ourselves,
that we are not... That none of us are alone.

1732
02:09:58,514 --> 02:10:02,353
I wish I could share that.

1733
02:10:04,754 --> 02:10:05,872
I wish...

1734
02:10:07,274 --> 02:10:11,153
...that everyone,
if even for one moment...

1735
02:10:11,314 --> 02:10:16,833
...could feel that awe
and humility and hope.

1736
02:10:17,233 --> 02:10:19,152
But...

1737
02:10:25,072 --> 02:10:27,271
That continues to be my wish.

1738
02:11:06,749 --> 02:11:09,947
Dr. Arroway, get a picture, please?
Get a photo over here?

1739
02:11:11,509 --> 02:11:13,067
Here comes Ellie.

1740
02:11:47,866 --> 02:11:50,665
Reverend Joss! Reverend Joss!

1741
02:11:50,826 --> 02:11:54,064
Reverend Joss, what do you believe?
What do you believe?

1742
02:11:58,146 --> 02:12:01,984
As a person of faith, I'm bound by
a different covenant than Dr. Arroway.

1743
02:12:03,664 --> 02:12:05,824
But our goal is one and the same.

1744
02:12:06,304 --> 02:12:07,864
The pursuit of truth.

1745
02:12:11,264 --> 02:12:12,503
I, for one, believe her.

1746
02:12:35,102 --> 02:12:37,861
So, what happens now?
We give her a medal?

1747
02:12:38,022 --> 02:12:40,781
I'd say at least a healthy grant.

1748
02:12:40,942 --> 02:12:44,260
I assume you read the confidential report
from the investigating committee?

1749
02:12:44,461 --> 02:12:46,140
I flipped through it.

1750
02:12:46,301 --> 02:12:50,340
I was especially interested
in the section on Arroway's video unit.

1751
02:12:51,101 --> 02:12:53,339
The one that recorded the static.

1752
02:12:54,540 --> 02:12:56,180
Continue.

1753
02:12:56,780 --> 02:13:00,459
The fact that it recorded static
isn't what interests me.

1754
02:13:05,099 --> 02:13:06,419
Continue.

1755
02:13:07,260 --> 02:13:09,019
What interests me...

1756
02:13:09,180 --> 02:13:12,858
...is that it recorded
approximately 18 hours of it.

1757
02:13:17,899 --> 02:13:19,738
That is interesting, isn't it?

1758
02:13:26,138 --> 02:13:29,817
You can see over there,
we're building 45 brand-new dishes.

1759
02:13:29,978 --> 02:13:33,777
And that means when you put them
together with all the radio telescopes...

1760
02:13:33,938 --> 02:13:35,377
...all over the world...

1761
02:13:35,538 --> 02:13:40,017
...then we get to hear farther into space
than anybody has ever heard before.

1762
02:13:40,178 --> 02:13:41,175
Yeah.

1763
02:13:41,336 --> 02:13:44,055
Are there other people
out there in the universe?

1764
02:13:45,056 --> 02:13:47,695
That's a good question.
What do you think, huh?

1765
02:13:48,256 --> 02:13:51,454
- I don't know.
- That's a good answer.

1766
02:13:52,295 --> 02:13:53,295
Skeptic, huh?

1767
02:13:54,535 --> 02:13:59,214
The important thing is that you all
keep searching for your own answers.

1768
02:13:59,375 --> 02:14:02,094
I'll tell you one thing
about the universe, though.

1769
02:14:02,255 --> 02:14:05,974
The universe is a pretty big place.

1770
02:14:06,935 --> 02:14:12,213
It's bigger than anything
anyone has ever dreamed of before.

1771
02:14:13,734 --> 02:14:15,333
So if it's just us...

1772
02:14:16,894 --> 02:14:19,572
...it seems like an awful waste of space.

1773
02:14:21,014 --> 02:14:22,332
Right?
